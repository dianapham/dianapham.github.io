    <id>http://dianapham.github.io/blog/2014/04/22/anxiety</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I had a mild anxiety attack earlier. The result of that is that my upper left side is searing in pain. LAMESIES.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s something to do with an adrenaline burst, tightly contracting muscles and an abundant acid production. Meh. Alls I know is I felt this feeling for something like three years and I really don&rsquo;t want to feel it anymore.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t really feel like talking about what happened for three years. It&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;m not willing to, it&rsquo;s more like I have a ton of work I want to do so I don&rsquo;t really have time to babble one about that shit. However, I will talk a bit about what my anxiety attack was about earlier.</p>

<p>I have one friend here in Seattle that I&rsquo;d do anything for: my best friend in Seattle. He&rsquo;s my roommate now. A lot of people have claimed that we&rsquo;re dating and whatnot, but they&rsquo;re just being ignorant. I think of him as a brother. He&rsquo;s one of the first few people I met when I moved to Seattle. I didn&rsquo;t meet him right away as if I openly talked to him or anything. I actually hated him for the first year I knew him. He was such an asshole at work. But when I switched to a different department and ended up having to work with him, I realized he was a really good guy. He came off as an asshole because he needed to get his work done. And cuz &ldquo;someone&rdquo; needed to put people in their place.</p>

<p>We quickly became friends. We bonded over broski things like UFC, MMA and idiocy at work. I was sick though. I had bad mood swings. I was still trying to figure out my histamine issues. I was still getting hives and migraines. He&rsquo;d always be there though. He wouldn&rsquo;t go out of his way to comfort me, but if I ever needed help, he&rsquo;d be there. That&rsquo;s all I needed.</p>

<p>Sometimes I&rsquo;d go weeks not talking to him. Sometimes months. But everytime I reached out, he&rsquo;d be there. That&rsquo;s a lot to ask from most people. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s his apathy that allows him to be like he is or whatever, but I don&rsquo;t really think about it anymore. We&rsquo;ve been through so much in our friendship (mostly because of my drama) that we&rsquo;re just friends now. It&rsquo;s accepted that we&rsquo;re friends. Like, forever.</p>

<p>So yeah. The difference with him compared to my other friends is that he&rsquo;s anti-social and apathetic. I feel like it&rsquo;d be difficult to hang out with him or talk to him if he wasn&rsquo;t in the immediate area. So that&rsquo;s what I was panicking about. He mentioned something about moving to Oregon at the end of the year.</p>

<p>UH. NO.</p>

<p>After a lengthy conversation filled with my dramatics, I believe I secured him staying in Seattle.</p>

<p>Thank gosh.</p>

<p>But yeah, I&rsquo;m dealing with the reprecussions of my anxiety attack now. It&rsquo;s annoying, but at least in the grand scheme of things, I still have my friend.</p>

<p>Yay.</p>

Aren&rsquo;t these just adorable?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m really glad I randomly started doing pixel art again. It makes me feel like I have a chance at making that game I wanted to make years ago.</p>

<p>I wish when I had more support when I was younger to do things that I wanted. I aspired to do some many things with technology. I really wanted to get into game development, but I had no idea how to go about it. It sucks I wasn&rsquo;t persistant about it. Iono. I understand why I stopped trying though. I was tired of people using me. I knew the better I got at doing things like photo editing, the more people would make me do stuff for them.</p>

<p>My mom would always wake me up at 5 or 6 in the morning and make me edit pictures for her. It was really annoying. I&rsquo;d have to clean up the cat&rsquo;s poop and then go work for my mom. I remember always being really hungry.</p>

<p>When our computers started glitching out, I kinda just left it. I didn&rsquo;t care anymore. I didn&rsquo;t want to work for her anymore. Plus, she already told me to not get into computer work. So like, whatever right?</p>

<p>Meh.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard to be indifferent. I get so bitter and angry. I don&rsquo;t like it when I&rsquo;m like that. So I become indifferent. But that in turn comes with a price.</p>

<p>MEH.</p>

<p>Whatever. I can still do what I want. I&rsquo;m stuck there anymore.</p>

<p>On a brighter not, I finally cut my fingernails. Heyoo!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m glad I met my boyfriend and then his friends. They&rsquo;re all in game dev and it&rsquo;s just a really nice community to be associated with. I&rsquo;m like, going full circle into what I used to want to do. I guess now it&rsquo;s still what I wanna do. So yeah. YEAH.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve always been interested in pixel art. Since like iono, my elementary school years. Whenever we got our first Gameboy. Years later, I got really obsessed with Harvest Moon Friends of Mineral Town. I really wanted to create my own RPG that involved cooking. Basically everything that Harvest Moon did with their kitchen except just have the game centered around that instead of farming. I remember thinking, &ldquo;How hard is it to build a game?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hah.</p>

<p>Hah.</p>

<p>Yeah. It&rsquo;s kinda hard. I drafted the characters and environment, but I had no idea how to get anything on the computer. Like, &ldquo;programming&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t cross my mind at all. I had no idea what to do. Then freaking Cooking Mama came out and I was like, UGH.</p>

<p>I still kinda wanna make the game though. Stardew Valley is still in the development. I can&rsquo;t wait until that&rsquo;s released.</p>

<p>Anyway, here&rsquo;s another thing of pixel art I made:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My fingernails are too long. I don&rsquo;t know how most girls have such long nails. It hinders typing too much. Such a hassle it is.</p>

<p>I finally backed up my computer the other day so I&rsquo;m going to reinstall everything hopefully today or tomorrow.</p>

<p>I have 1000 buttons on the table. I think I need more. Haha. Button sales seem to be going well. A lot of customers seem to like the more down to earth characters. I&rsquo;m still contemplating the direction in which I want to lead my company. It&rsquo;s frustrating not having the support I deem necessary, but whatever. If there&rsquo;s anything about me that y&#8217;all should know, it is that I don&rsquo;t take shit from anyone. There we go, curse away.</p>

<p>I really don&rsquo;t like working for inconsiderate assholes. I kinda grew up in that sort of environment and it&rsquo;s just unnecessary. It&rsquo;s stupid. It&rsquo;s annoying. And all in all, it&rsquo;s tiring.</p>

<p>I keep having flashbacks.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I&rsquo;ve contemplated whether I still want to keep this blog as just a tech-related blog or not. Whatever. I want people to know who I am. I don&rsquo;t see myself trying to apply to any big companies anytime soon. And if I ever do and they pass me cuz of what I write here, then whatever. I&rsquo;m kind of beyond the point of dealing with people who don&rsquo;t care about me and don&rsquo;t give me a chance. I will work my ass off for whatever I care about. But you know, that&rsquo;s the thing. I have to care first. So if you don&rsquo;t care about me then I&rsquo;m not going to care about you.</p>

<p>My mom once told me that if I wanted respect, I had to respect people first. She told me this while we were in her car on the driveway of our house. She was in the driver seat as I was in the back seat behind the passenger seat. The passenger seat was always full of papers. Painting the picture of the scene doesn&rsquo;t do much for this particular story, but it helps me remember. I&rsquo;ve been pushing everything back way too much. I need to let it out now. Cuz you know, I need therapy.</p>

<p>Anyway. There we were in driveway. We were about to leave to this Sunday Vietnamese School that she taught at. I took classes at this school, but seriously? I did not understand the language. I failed so many classes. She always asked the teachers to let me go on and that she&rsquo;d &ldquo;help&rdquo; me. Meh. I still failed. Eventually, I wasn&rsquo;t allowed to move up unless I actually passed and iono. It was agonizing. All these other little kids would pass and a fresh batch of kids would enter while I stayed. I felt so dumb. The problem was that they spoke the language at home so they understood all these words. I didn&rsquo;t. I could read and write, but comprehension was out the window.</p>

<p>I keep going on all these tangents. My writing kind of sucks now. MEH.</p>

<p>Whatever. Basically, I fumbled my way through all the grades and eventually made it to the last grade; the class that my mom taught. WELL! She said there was no way I was going to pass her class so I had to go up to the office to work for all the teachers. Oh great. Yeah, lemme go ahead and copy all the homework for the whole school in two hours. Lemme make y&#8217;all tea. Yeah, okay, I&rsquo;ll set out your food and clean up after you. Okay, I&rsquo;ll make sure all your supplies are in stock and clean. Okay, I&rsquo;ll go deliver all these papers and talk to people in a mangled version of your language so they&rsquo;ll get mad at me and call me stupid.</p>

<p>People always thought I was bitter and angry. Fuck yeah I was bitter and angry. But I was also fucking sad. I felt pathetic.</p>

<p>One day, I was sitting in front of stacks of papers that were supposed to go out to every class in the school. Some teacher came over and asked me in their language, &ldquo;Do we have to organize these papers?&rdquo; I was trying to form the words to say, &ldquo;I already organized them.&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t want to sound stupid so I took care to form the sentence in my mind before I said it. It look like ten seconds for each word. But no. Don&rsquo;t give me any goddamn time to not sound dumb. Go ahead and call me dumb. And angry. And worthless. Yes, I fucking organized those three hundred pieces of paper. Fuck you. You go pass them out.</p>

<p>Respect. &ldquo;You have to respect people if you want them to respect you.&rdquo; Doesn&rsquo;t it work the other way too? No one respected me so why did I have to respect them? I don&rsquo;t care if they were older or had &ldquo;higher positions.&rdquo; If you treat me like shit, I&rsquo;m not going to like you. Why should I respect you? Wasn&rsquo;t it enough I was your little bitch? Your &ldquo;office assistant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m still fucking bitter. People tell me it&rsquo;s over. That I don&rsquo;t have to think about it anymore. Well that&rsquo;s not true. I fucking remember it every single night. I cry and hide in closets. In two weeks, I&rsquo;m going to turn 24. Aren&rsquo;t I an adult? Why do I still feel like a child?</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know what I ever did to make people not like me. I always did what I was told. Was it a misunderstanding? Fuck yeah it was. Thanks for not trying to help me though.</p>

<p>I feel something boiling inside. I haven&rsquo;t felt it in years because I shoved it down to survive. I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m going to explode.</p>

<p>I think the point of all that was that if someone reads all and doesn&rsquo;t want to work with me then whatever. I really don&rsquo;t care. Culture fit is important to me. Being human is important to me. Keeping it real and all that.</p>

<p>When I give talks and stuff, I allude to how I had a rough childhood. I mumble something about how I&rsquo;m an angry person and everyone chuckles. It&rsquo;s pretty funny. I usually chuckle too. I really admire people who go through hardships and make the most of them. That&rsquo;s what I try to do all the time. I try to joke about things that happen. I use humor to handle everything. Sometimes it&rsquo;s too sarcastic and dry for people. Too much dark humor for the general public. But I need it. And I need to vent.</p>

<p>I really don&rsquo;t want to blow up.</p>

<p>So yeah. Here&rsquo;s me trying to reset again. To move on the correct way. Dealing with my issues instead of shoving them down. Three years ago, it was what I needed. I knew it&rsquo;d come back and haunt me. But I needed to survive. I couldn&rsquo;t deal with my past. Now that I&rsquo;m &ldquo;surviving,&rdquo; all of the past is crawling up to reach me. I&rsquo;m done just surviving. I think it&rsquo;s time to live.</p>

<p>Man, that got all mushy there didn&rsquo;t it? Gross.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m proud of everything I&rsquo;ve accomplished. I&rsquo;ve met a ton of awesome people. I want to keep meeting awesome people. I want to excel at everything I do just like I have been. I&rsquo;ve proven I can make it. Fuck the past. It wants to creept up so I&rsquo;ll throw it all out there, but after that I&rsquo;m gonna be all like, &ldquo;yo man, you had your time. get outta hurr.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m so lame sometimes. el oh el oh el.</p>

<p>Okay. Bye.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>What do you want, Beezy?</p>

<p>I almost cursed there. I&rsquo;ve been trying to cut down on that because curse too much. Also, if I&rsquo;m writing books for kids, what would it look like if I&rsquo;m cursing like a trucker? Actually, during my bootcamp, I remember people always remarking about how cursing is just part of the culture. Thank gosh.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m contemplating what I want to do with my company. I want to do A LOT. But I don&rsquo;t know if the avenue I&rsquo;m taking is the right way or not. It&rsquo;s really frustrating.</p>

<p>Also, I really don&rsquo;t like typing/reading white text over black. It hurts my eyes. I dunno if I&rsquo;d like it if I changed the template of SublimeText2 though. I like keeping things the standard way. GAH.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to make a list to try some markdown:</p>

<ul>
<li>I don&rsquo;t like wearing socks without shoes.</li>
<li>Toe segregation scares me.</li>
<li>Blueberry muffins are yummy, but blueberry cakes are weird.</li>
</ul>


<p>Ahh. Okay, so you have to use the same little bullet things to make them bullets. I don&rsquo;t like how my these has the bullets out of the main margin. Boogerszz. I&rsquo;ll fix that later.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I feel like all my posts pretty much start with the effect of, &ldquo;omg it&rsquo;s been forever since I&rsquo;ve posted!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meh.</p>

<p>The other day, it was brought to my attention that I haven&rsquo;t been writing much anymore. Back in the day, I used to write 8 pages of daily ramblings for something like 7 years? Back when Xanga was a really cool thing that everyone wrote on. I didn&rsquo;t have many followers, nor did I really follow anyone. But I really enjoyed writing. I didn&rsquo;t really know if anyone read my stuff, but it was super cathartic, so I kept it up. Sometimes I feel like I stopped writing because I get so OCD about it all. If I don&rsquo;t write one day then I get really stressed out that I didn&rsquo;t write and then I feel all bad and gross. No bueno.</p>

<p>In any case, I originally meant for this blog to be about tech related stuff, but I really don&rsquo;t like scoping that much. I need a place to just talk about anything. Since Xanga doesn&rsquo;t seem to be up anymore, I looked at other blogging platforms and just got frustrated. So here I am again. I&rsquo;ll write about whatever is on my mind. I really don&rsquo;t think many people are going to read this stuff anyway. Whatevs.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m working on my Rad Randy app for DinoHulk. Freaking error is driving me crazy:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Application windows are expected to have a root view controller at the end of application launch&rdquo;</p>

<p>UGHHHH. I&rsquo;ll figure it out tomorrow. BLEH.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to make an effort at making this blog better. I guess I want to have it be my personal website too. Blah blah. Grumble ramble.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yes, yes. I know I need to update my blog more. Code Fellows is pretty intense. Oh, am I listing excuses? I hate listing excuses. I&rsquo;ll call them &ldquo;better use of my time at the current phase of my life&rdquo;:</p>

<ol>
<li>code fellows &ndash; learning all the time + projects = not a lot of time</li>
<li>work &ndash; I NEED TO EAT SO I HAVE TO WORK!</li>
<li>the heat &ndash; histamine overload. always have to make sure my body temperature doesn&rsquo;t go chaotic and make me sick. damn the sun!</li>
</ol>


<p>So yeah, in text that doesn&rsquo;t sound like much and I really should be able to get a short blurb out here and there. But I guess it&rsquo;s also that I really want to change this layout. Ughhh. I&rsquo;ll do that this weekend. Probably. Maybe. I dunno.</p>

<p>Also, the custom domain thing is killing me. It takes too long to load. Uber frustrating.</p>

<p>Until the next time I actually post. HUZZAH!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As of this current date and time, if you look to the right side column of this page, you&rsquo;ll see an embedded twitter widget. YES! I finally got around to putting that in there. I didn&rsquo;t have much on my twitter before, but I&rsquo;ve been tweeting a lot more about my learning process there, so why not?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve installed zsh in my command prompt and it wasn&rsquo;t working with my octopress blog so I had to switch back to bash. I&rsquo;ll have to configure that somehow. But yeah I learned how to switch between them.</p>

<p>Switch to bash:</p>

<pre><code>exec bash
</code></pre>

<p>Switch to zsh</p>

<pre><code>exec zsh
</code></pre>

<p>Yeah that&rsquo;s pretty straight forward.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m really enjoying this Code Fellows bootcamp. I&rsquo;ve learned so much in such a great environment. By that I mean, the actual physical building itself and the people that surround me, but also the programming environment. It&rsquo;s so cool.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>My last SQL Server class ended on Wednesday and that was pretty awesome. My instructor was trying to show us how to issue jobs off SQL Server Agent and it turned out he didn&rsquo;t have permission on his login because the school wipes the computers every night. Blah blah did stuff blah. Then eventually:</p>

<p>him: &ldquo;Alright, well, can someone connect to my server and give me rights?&rdquo;
students: <em>look around/do stuff</em>
him: &ldquo;Has anyone connected?&rdquo;
me: &ldquo;I connected.&rdquo;
him: &ldquo;Oh cool, can you set my permissions?&rdquo;
me: &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; <em>change login permissions and rights</em>
him: &ldquo;See, it&rsquo;s always great to have a sys admin in your back pocket. You know, just in case you lock yourself out.&rdquo;
me: &ldquo;Okay, it&rsquo;s done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>(But really I was thinking, &ldquo;OMG I&rsquo;M A SYS ADMIN! HE CALLED ME A SYS ADMIN!&rdquo;)</p>

<p>him: &ldquo;Thanks. Alright, so here we see&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>And yeah, it was totally cool. It&rsquo;s great being able to utilize what you&rsquo;ve learned to help learn more stuff. UNGH! I seriously don&rsquo;t know why I love this stuff so much, but I just do.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to bridge the gap between the database mindset and the programming mindset. Actually, I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s more bridging the gap or just understanding what the difference is. I&rsquo;m learning about databases and programming and for some reason I keep finding articles about how there&rsquo;s a separation. Separation of powers!?</p>

<p>I dunno.</p>

<p>Anyway, I really like my db classes, but I&rsquo;ve decided to opt out of the classes I signed up for in August because I want to focus on Code Fellows. Actually, I&rsquo;m for surely in the Silver bootcamp (I&rsquo;m currently partaking in it) and I&rsquo;m pending Gold. One of my instructors said that pretty much everyone makes it into Gold so I should just focus on working hard. Yeah I can do that. I&rsquo;m good at working hard.</p>

<p>-insert life story-</p>

<p>Sighh. Too cool. Life is good right now. Yay.</p>

<p>[histamine intolerance is relatively in check now too.]</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m starting my Intro to HTML &amp; CSS course today. SUPER EXCITED!</p>

<p>We have to come prepared with materials for a mock website. It&rsquo;s just for funsies so I&rsquo;m going to create a website compiling all my cartoon drawings. I was thinking I&rsquo;d just include all of my artsy stuff, but nah. The simple cartoon idea will be enough for class and I&rsquo;ll just implement everything I learn into making this blog better. I&rsquo;d rather just have one site for now. You know, make one site look hella good.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still fumbling around with the code fellows HTML problem. UGH. I can&rsquo;t get the append function to work the way I want it to. Hopefully, I&rsquo;ll learn about it or can ask someone about it in the HTML class I take tonight.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the most recent cartoon I drew at work:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-g0nhTW2a7-I/Uc8f4uhZ5hI/AAAAAAAAC5U/zhrZveApsyw/s1600/IMG020.jpg" width="600"></p>

<p>I need to get a new phone. Apparently, I&rsquo;m not receiving incoming calls and my text messages aren&rsquo;t going out. Boo. Plus, the camera is getting iffy. BLAH. I&rsquo;ve gotta save up though.</p>

<p>OH! I totally had $5.30 surplus from my little budget experiment. Bwahaha! I&rsquo;m so good at budgeting. The last thing I bought in June was food for this week. Oh the things I can get with $5.30. That&rsquo;s like, a whole &lsquo;nother week of food almost! Cheap asian produce market ftw!</p>

<p>&mdash; update 6:57pm &mdash;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m at the class right now and I feel so&hellip;cool. Haha. :)</p>

<p>Like, there are all these women here with their laptops setup and ready to learn this techy stuff. YAY!</p>

<p>I feel like I&rsquo;m a part of something and it&rsquo;s nice. Huzzah!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this morning, I got an email from Code Fellows saying I&rsquo;m in the &ldquo;<em>final pool</em>&rdquo; of applications. They&rsquo;ll be deciding next week who gets in. Oh man, the past week has been so stressful with regards to Code Fellows. The past month if anything!</p>

<p>The challenge questions they sent were fairly simple in theory, as in I understood what they wanted, but in practice&hellip;AGHH!! I realized early on that I totally did not know enough to do any of the problems so I did what I do best which is to self teach. My eyes have been killing me the past week because of how much I&rsquo;ve been reading.</p>

<p>Between work, school and lack of technical skills, I asked for an extension on the time the problems were to be due and they said that was fine. Often times, I&rsquo;d feel bad that I was taking so long to get the stuff done, but man! I really don&rsquo;t know this stuff! I&rsquo;m trying really hard to get it all done though. I&rsquo;m almost there. The first question using Ruby is done. The HTML one is still troubling me.</p>

<p>Right after I got the email from Code Fellows this morning, I got an email from this women&rsquo;s tech meetup. The subject was &ldquo;Intro to HTML and CSS.&rdquo; I read the subject and was like, &ldquo;OMG THAT&rsquo;S EXACTLY WHAT I NEED RIGHT NOW!&rdquo; Unfortunately, I need it now instead of next week when the classes are offered, but I signed up anyway. It&rsquo;s a 4 class series. I think it&rsquo;ll be beneficial. The email said only 5 spots were left. When I finally got around to checking it out, there was only 1 spot left. I took it.</p>

<p>So yeah. I&rsquo;m gonna be doing that for the month of July on Tuesday nights. DB classes Monday and Wednesday nights. If I get into Code Fellows, it&rsquo;ll be M-F 9am-4pm. I think I read that some people stay after 4pm to work on stuff, but I really want to finish my DB classes. I really enjoy them.</p>

<p>Okay, back to learning more about HTML. At least enough to finish this problem!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Seriously, I feel like my brain is pushing against my skull. I&rsquo;m soaking in so much information right now. I told someone I&rsquo;m &ldquo;drying my eyes out&rdquo; trying to learn ruby and html.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I received a message about scholarships for Code Fellows if I got into the program. I sent answers to the scholarship questions then this morning I received another message about final application questions. More like, final application problems. I have to create some stuff and holy moly bologna! The things I have to make are a little beyond my scope, but I mean, that&rsquo;s kind of what&rsquo;s making this all so fun. I&rsquo;m learning all this crazy shizzniz.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been getting really frustrated trying to figure these things out, but I think ten hours later, I&rsquo;m really getting somewhere. There are three problems and I&rsquo;ve pretty much got all of them half done. I think that&rsquo;s a good start! Haha. In theory, I know what I need to do, it&rsquo;s just making it all be real that I&rsquo;m working on. If I could use MS Access or better yet, SQL Server, I could get all this done pretty quickly, but I&rsquo;ve gotta build it all from scratch so yeah. That&rsquo;s the point! To learn!</p>

<p>Something I&rsquo;ve learned about myself is that my frustration dances and my success dances are pretty much the same; the only differences are my facial expressions. I jump up and down, express obscenities, thrash my limbs around, it looks like I&rsquo;m squinting in both dances. In my frustrated dance, I glare at everything. In my success dance I&rsquo;m smiling. Haha. I think I can model that! But I&rsquo;ll do that a little later. I gotta finish these things.</p>

<p>Huzzahhh!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Currently, I have 50 bucks in my wallet. My goal for the rest of the month is not to spend any money at all (besides automatic payments for bills) and if I really have to, then that 50 bucks in my wallet will be my fund. I mean, I&rsquo;ll still have my debit and credit cards, but I really want to see if I can do this. I used to live off of so little and now that I&rsquo;m more financially secure, I&rsquo;ve been splurging on going out to eat with people.</p>

<p>Actually, yeah this monetary limitation will help with my diet because I&rsquo;ve been eating out way too much and getting hives. I&rsquo;ll have to dedicate a page to my histamine intolerance.</p>

<p>To do list for this blog:</p>

<pre><code>- landing page (index)
- change the font to the post titles
- add youtube plugin
- add disqus account
- page: singing videos
- page: art projects 
- page: histamine intolerance
- change domain
- twitter? (eh, I don't use it that much)
</code></pre>

<p>That&rsquo;s it so far.</p>

<p>Even though I didn&rsquo;t code this whole blog from scratch on my own (totally don&rsquo;t know enough to do that right now), I definitely do find joy and fulfillment in learning how to change the code as I please. Yay for technology!</p>

<p>But yeah, it&rsquo;d be so ballin&#8217; if I get into Code Fellows (I should hear back from them by the end of this week or early next week whether I get in or not). If I don&rsquo;t get in, then I&rsquo;m gonna really focus on learning more database and programming. Also, I&rsquo;m getting my diet straightened out so I need to really stick with that so I don&rsquo;t get sick so much. AND I renewed my membership for climbing so I gotta get my butt out to go exercise.</p>

<p>Ultimate frisbee this evening!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m gaining control of my life again. Thank gosh!</p>

    <link href="http://dianapham.github.io/blog/2013/06/17/ice-cream-solves-everything/"/>
    <updated>2013-06-17T21:36:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://dianapham.github.io/blog/2013/06/17/ice-cream-solves-everything</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Biv4YvS2yyE/Ub_nQRlpf9I/AAAAAAAAC3w/G7Q5kVhIJTs/s1600/icecream.jpg" width="600"></p>

<p>One of the questions on the Code Fellows application was something like: &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the best thing ever?&rdquo; I said ice cream. I went on to talk about how walking around with an ice cream cone was the most innocent and sincere thing ever. Also, I noted how I once saw a group of bikers walking around with ice cream cones; totally all sorts of juxtaposed adorable.</p>

<p>Anyway, I made it to the final level of applications for Code Fellows; a ten minute in-person interview. I was super excited. I emailed them my availability which was basically saying I&rsquo;d take the earliest slot they had. I ended up seeing them the next day, Friday. I was really excited and amped up to talk to these guys. I really wanted to show how dedicated and driven I was for my future, but when the interview started, I totally blanked. I&rsquo;ve always wondered about how people say they&rsquo;ve never been like &ldquo;something&rdquo; before, but then for the first time they messed up or whatever. I didn&rsquo;t know what that felt like. I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;m explaining that correctly or not. But basically, I blanked out. I seriously could not articulate when they asked me to define basic programming terminologies.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>&ldquo;What is a class?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seriously!? That was one of the first things you learn! Why did I blank out? I fumbled around like I didn&rsquo;t know what I was talking about. I was embarrassed that I had just said I finished all these tracks on codecademy and took other online courses, but then I couldn&rsquo;t even explain a class. You don&rsquo;t really even have to know about programming to explain what a class is! Mathematical subsets! Animal classifications! Ach! I was disappointed in myself. I felt my confidence level dropping after that moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is an object?&rdquo;</p>

<p>OMG. Really? Yeah. I couldn&rsquo;t think. Actually, I remember thinking the word &ldquo;static&rdquo; and I think I was probably trying to reach the word &ldquo;instance&rdquo; to use that in my definition, but jeepers creepers! What was wrong with me? I tried to merge over to where I felt more comfortable with database so I thought of the objects in databases and kind of explained it like that, but man! GAH!</p>

<p>Anyway, I tried my best to keep composure. I ended up telling them a lot about myself and what I&rsquo;ve been through to get here (to Seattle, where I am today figuratively and literally). I always mentally tell myself to tone down how much I tell people about my past, but it&rsquo;s hard because my past has been such a huge factor in shaping who I am and what I do today. Isn&rsquo;t that how it is for everyone?</p>

<p>Soooo, yeah. I think it went alright, but I didn&rsquo;t feel as confident as I normally do after my interviews. Usually, I always feel like I&rsquo;m on top of the world after an interview. This was the first one that made me feeling like I knew nothing and I just embarrassed myself. Is it because I actually really really want this?</p>

<p>Notes of the interview:</p>

<pre><code>- intros
- blogs and articles
- what is a class
- what is an object
- how does the internet work?
- my code, github, octopress (what's this line? what does this mean?)
- what code to look at
- octopress - framework, only basic modifications 
- html - what is this?
- what is a stylesheet?
- why code fellows?
- education and networking
- who brought up the idea for a woman's bootcamp
- legos, buidling things, middle school, gundam
- jiu jitsu - technical explanations vs all hands-on
- women and men think differently
- good chance
- handshakes
- sunglasses
</code></pre>

<p>Man. Alright. It&rsquo;s out of my hands now.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m gonna continue trying to learn stuff on my own regardless. I&rsquo;m trying not to be too &ldquo;meh&rdquo; about it. I just don&rsquo;t understand the mindset I was in because that honestly never happened to me before. I can now understand how other people feel when they say they don&rsquo;t understand how things that never happen end up happening. More like, things NOT happening.</p>

<p>Saturday was the last day of my SQL Level 1 course at Bellevue College. It was a good class. I learned a helluva lot. I&rsquo;m super excited for the next class in the series. I really like learning SQL. It just makes sense! It&rsquo;s so intuitive. FUNSIES! I feel like a kid in class because I&rsquo;m so wide eyed curious as to what does what. It&rsquo;s great.</p>

<p>Oh, one thing I talked about during my interview was how I didn&rsquo;t have degree and how at the moment I felt like I could get along with just networking and a skills I learn on my own. Well, on my own or through different classes not necessarily from a degree track. I still get jealous and a little bitter when people talk to me about college. Just today, one of my coworkers mentioned school to me and how I should apply to all these different schools and how it would be good for me. I knew she was just trying to help, just like most people, but I can&rsquo;t shake the annoyance I always feel.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve tried very hard and am still trying very hard to get my life to go somewhere. A formal college education just hasn&rsquo;t been the most favorable route. I ran out of my money and I&rsquo;m still not old enough to apply for financial aid by myself so I can&rsquo;t do anything about that except accept it and do something else. I&rsquo;ve come to terms with just having to do something else&mdash;on my own. I wish people would respect that and just let me be. I know they don&rsquo;t mean harm, but sheesh! Give me some credit!</p>

<p>College is a touchy subject for me. /endtopic</p>

<p>Anyway, no matter what, I know I&rsquo;m amazing. I know I have a lot of potential. I know I&rsquo;ll make something of my life. I&rsquo;ve already done so much, so why stop? I&rsquo;m tired of feeling like I&rsquo;m worthless like how people used to make me feel. I don&rsquo;t need that. AIN&rsquo;T GOT NO TIME FOR THAT! I&rsquo;VE GOT ASTHMA!</p>

<p>Haha.</p>

<p>Whether I get into Code Fellows or not, I&rsquo;ll be okay. You either win or you learn!</p>

<p>I knew that would want ice cream after my interview. I didn&rsquo;t anticipate needing to be consoled, but that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s so great about ice cream; it can be eaten to celebrate or console. I got ice cream for both. To console my embarrassment, but also to celebrate the revelation of how far I&rsquo;ve already gotten in life.</p>

<p>Ice cream is the best.</p>
