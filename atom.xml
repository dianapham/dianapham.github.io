    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I feel like all my posts pretty much start with the effect of, &ldquo;omg it&rsquo;s been forever since I&rsquo;ve posted!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meh.</p>

<p>The other day, it was brought to my attention that I haven&rsquo;t been writing much anymore. Back in the day, I used to write 8 pages of daily ramblings for something like 7 years? Back when Xanga was a really cool thing that everyone wrote on. I didn&rsquo;t have many followers, nor did I really follow anyone. But I really enjoyed writing. I didn&rsquo;t really know if anyone read my stuff, but it was super cathartic, so I kept it up. Sometimes I feel like I stopped writing because I get so OCD about it all. If I don&rsquo;t write one day then I get really stressed out that I didn&rsquo;t write and then I feel all bad and gross. No bueno.</p>

<p>In any case, I originally meant for this blog to be about tech related stuff, but I really don&rsquo;t like scoping that much. I need a place to just talk about anything. Since Xanga doesn&rsquo;t seem to be up anymore, I looked at other blogging platforms and just got frustrated. So here I am again. I&rsquo;ll write about whatever is on my mind. I really don&rsquo;t think many people are going to read this stuff anyway. Whatevs.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m working on my Rad Randy app for DinoHulk. Freaking error is driving me crazy:</p>

<p>\ts&#8221;Application windows are expected to have a root view controller at the end of application launch&#8221;</p>

<p>UGHHHH. I&rsquo;ll figure it out tomorrow. BLEH.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to make an effort at making this blog better. I guess I want to have it be my personal website too. Blah blah. Grumble ramble.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yes, yes. I know I need to update my blog more. Code Fellows is pretty intense. Oh, am I listing excuses? I hate listing excuses. I&rsquo;ll call them &ldquo;better use of my time at the current phase of my life&rdquo;:</p>

<ol>
<li>code fellows &ndash; learning all the time + projects = not a lot of time</li>
<li>work &ndash; I NEED TO EAT SO I HAVE TO WORK!</li>
<li>the heat &ndash; histamine overload. always have to make sure my body temperature doesn&rsquo;t go chaotic and make me sick. damn the sun!</li>
</ol>


<p>So yeah, in text that doesn&rsquo;t sound like much and I really should be able to get a short blurb out here and there. But I guess it&rsquo;s also that I really want to change this layout. Ughhh. I&rsquo;ll do that this weekend. Probably. Maybe. I dunno.</p>

<p>Also, the custom domain thing is killing me. It takes too long to load. Uber frustrating.</p>

<p>Until the next time I actually post. HUZZAH!</p>

    <id>http://dianapham.github.io/blog/2013/07/12/twitter-widget</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As of this current date and time, if you look to the right side column of this page, you&rsquo;ll see an embedded twitter widget. YES! I finally got around to putting that in there. I didn&rsquo;t have much on my twitter before, but I&rsquo;ve been tweeting a lot more about my learning process there, so why not?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve installed zsh in my command prompt and it wasn&rsquo;t working with my octopress blog so I had to switch back to bash. I&rsquo;ll have to configure that somehow. But yeah I learned how to switch between them.</p>

<p>Switch to bash:</p>

<pre><code>exec bash
</code></pre>

<p>Switch to zsh</p>

<pre><code>exec zsh
</code></pre>

<p>Yeah that&rsquo;s pretty straight forward.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m really enjoying this Code Fellows bootcamp. I&rsquo;ve learned so much in such a great environment. By that I mean, the actual physical building itself and the people that surround me, but also the programming environment. It&rsquo;s so cool.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>My last SQL Server class ended on Wednesday and that was pretty awesome. My instructor was trying to show us how to issue jobs off SQL Server Agent and it turned out he didn&rsquo;t have permission on his login because the school wipes the computers every night. Blah blah did stuff blah. Then eventually:</p>

<p>him: &ldquo;Alright, well, can someone connect to my server and give me rights?&rdquo;
students: <em>look around/do stuff</em>
him: &ldquo;Has anyone connected?&rdquo;
me: &ldquo;I connected.&rdquo;
him: &ldquo;Oh cool, can you set my permissions?&rdquo;
me: &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; <em>change login permissions and rights</em>
him: &ldquo;See, it&rsquo;s always great to have a sys admin in your back pocket. You know, just in case you lock yourself out.&rdquo;
me: &ldquo;Okay, it&rsquo;s done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>(But really I was thinking, &ldquo;OMG I&rsquo;M A SYS ADMIN! HE CALLED ME A SYS ADMIN!&rdquo;)</p>

<p>him: &ldquo;Thanks. Alright, so here we see&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>And yeah, it was totally cool. It&rsquo;s great being able to utilize what you&rsquo;ve learned to help learn more stuff. UNGH! I seriously don&rsquo;t know why I love this stuff so much, but I just do.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to bridge the gap between the database mindset and the programming mindset. Actually, I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s more bridging the gap or just understanding what the difference is. I&rsquo;m learning about databases and programming and for some reason I keep finding articles about how there&rsquo;s a separation. Separation of powers!?</p>

<p>I dunno.</p>

<p>Anyway, I really like my db classes, but I&rsquo;ve decided to opt out of the classes I signed up for in August because I want to focus on Code Fellows. Actually, I&rsquo;m for surely in the Silver bootcamp (I&rsquo;m currently partaking in it) and I&rsquo;m pending Gold. One of my instructors said that pretty much everyone makes it into Gold so I should just focus on working hard. Yeah I can do that. I&rsquo;m good at working hard.</p>

<p>-insert life story-</p>

<p>Sighh. Too cool. Life is good right now. Yay.</p>

<p>[histamine intolerance is relatively in check now too.]</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m starting my Intro to HTML &amp; CSS course today. SUPER EXCITED!</p>

<p>We have to come prepared with materials for a mock website. It&rsquo;s just for funsies so I&rsquo;m going to create a website compiling all my cartoon drawings. I was thinking I&rsquo;d just include all of my artsy stuff, but nah. The simple cartoon idea will be enough for class and I&rsquo;ll just implement everything I learn into making this blog better. I&rsquo;d rather just have one site for now. You know, make one site look hella good.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still fumbling around with the code fellows HTML problem. UGH. I can&rsquo;t get the append function to work the way I want it to. Hopefully, I&rsquo;ll learn about it or can ask someone about it in the HTML class I take tonight.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the most recent cartoon I drew at work:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-g0nhTW2a7-I/Uc8f4uhZ5hI/AAAAAAAAC5U/zhrZveApsyw/s1600/IMG020.jpg" width="600"></p>

<p>I need to get a new phone. Apparently, I&rsquo;m not receiving incoming calls and my text messages aren&rsquo;t going out. Boo. Plus, the camera is getting iffy. BLAH. I&rsquo;ve gotta save up though.</p>

<p>OH! I totally had $5.30 surplus from my little budget experiment. Bwahaha! I&rsquo;m so good at budgeting. The last thing I bought in June was food for this week. Oh the things I can get with $5.30. That&rsquo;s like, a whole &lsquo;nother week of food almost! Cheap asian produce market ftw!</p>

<p>&mdash; update 6:57pm &mdash;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m at the class right now and I feel so&hellip;cool. Haha. :)</p>

<p>Like, there are all these women here with their laptops setup and ready to learn this techy stuff. YAY!</p>

<p>I feel like I&rsquo;m a part of something and it&rsquo;s nice. Huzzah!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this morning, I got an email from Code Fellows saying I&rsquo;m in the &ldquo;<em>final pool</em>&rdquo; of applications. They&rsquo;ll be deciding next week who gets in. Oh man, the past week has been so stressful with regards to Code Fellows. The past month if anything!</p>

<p>The challenge questions they sent were fairly simple in theory, as in I understood what they wanted, but in practice&hellip;AGHH!! I realized early on that I totally did not know enough to do any of the problems so I did what I do best which is to self teach. My eyes have been killing me the past week because of how much I&rsquo;ve been reading.</p>

<p>Between work, school and lack of technical skills, I asked for an extension on the time the problems were to be due and they said that was fine. Often times, I&rsquo;d feel bad that I was taking so long to get the stuff done, but man! I really don&rsquo;t know this stuff! I&rsquo;m trying really hard to get it all done though. I&rsquo;m almost there. The first question using Ruby is done. The HTML one is still troubling me.</p>

<p>Right after I got the email from Code Fellows this morning, I got an email from this women&rsquo;s tech meetup. The subject was &ldquo;Intro to HTML and CSS.&rdquo; I read the subject and was like, &ldquo;OMG THAT&rsquo;S EXACTLY WHAT I NEED RIGHT NOW!&rdquo; Unfortunately, I need it now instead of next week when the classes are offered, but I signed up anyway. It&rsquo;s a 4 class series. I think it&rsquo;ll be beneficial. The email said only 5 spots were left. When I finally got around to checking it out, there was only 1 spot left. I took it.</p>

<p>So yeah. I&rsquo;m gonna be doing that for the month of July on Tuesday nights. DB classes Monday and Wednesday nights. If I get into Code Fellows, it&rsquo;ll be M-F 9am-4pm. I think I read that some people stay after 4pm to work on stuff, but I really want to finish my DB classes. I really enjoy them.</p>

<p>Okay, back to learning more about HTML. At least enough to finish this problem!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Seriously, I feel like my brain is pushing against my skull. I&rsquo;m soaking in so much information right now. I told someone I&rsquo;m &ldquo;drying my eyes out&rdquo; trying to learn ruby and html.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I received a message about scholarships for Code Fellows if I got into the program. I sent answers to the scholarship questions then this morning I received another message about final application questions. More like, final application problems. I have to create some stuff and holy moly bologna! The things I have to make are a little beyond my scope, but I mean, that&rsquo;s kind of what&rsquo;s making this all so fun. I&rsquo;m learning all this crazy shizzniz.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been getting really frustrated trying to figure these things out, but I think ten hours later, I&rsquo;m really getting somewhere. There are three problems and I&rsquo;ve pretty much got all of them half done. I think that&rsquo;s a good start! Haha. In theory, I know what I need to do, it&rsquo;s just making it all be real that I&rsquo;m working on. If I could use MS Access or better yet, SQL Server, I could get all this done pretty quickly, but I&rsquo;ve gotta build it all from scratch so yeah. That&rsquo;s the point! To learn!</p>

<p>Something I&rsquo;ve learned about myself is that my frustration dances and my success dances are pretty much the same; the only differences are my facial expressions. I jump up and down, express obscenities, thrash my limbs around, it looks like I&rsquo;m squinting in both dances. In my frustrated dance, I glare at everything. In my success dance I&rsquo;m smiling. Haha. I think I can model that! But I&rsquo;ll do that a little later. I gotta finish these things.</p>

<p>Huzzahhh!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Currently, I have 50 bucks in my wallet. My goal for the rest of the month is not to spend any money at all (besides automatic payments for bills) and if I really have to, then that 50 bucks in my wallet will be my fund. I mean, I&rsquo;ll still have my debit and credit cards, but I really want to see if I can do this. I used to live off of so little and now that I&rsquo;m more financially secure, I&rsquo;ve been splurging on going out to eat with people.</p>

<p>Actually, yeah this monetary limitation will help with my diet because I&rsquo;ve been eating out way too much and getting hives. I&rsquo;ll have to dedicate a page to my histamine intolerance.</p>

<p>To do list for this blog:</p>

<pre><code>- landing page (index)
- change the font to the post titles
- add youtube plugin
- add disqus account
- page: singing videos
- page: art projects 
- page: histamine intolerance
- change domain
- twitter? (eh, I don't use it that much)
</code></pre>

<p>That&rsquo;s it so far.</p>

<p>Even though I didn&rsquo;t code this whole blog from scratch on my own (totally don&rsquo;t know enough to do that right now), I definitely do find joy and fulfillment in learning how to change the code as I please. Yay for technology!</p>

<p>But yeah, it&rsquo;d be so ballin&#8217; if I get into Code Fellows (I should hear back from them by the end of this week or early next week whether I get in or not). If I don&rsquo;t get in, then I&rsquo;m gonna really focus on learning more database and programming. Also, I&rsquo;m getting my diet straightened out so I need to really stick with that so I don&rsquo;t get sick so much. AND I renewed my membership for climbing so I gotta get my butt out to go exercise.</p>

<p>Ultimate frisbee this evening!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m gaining control of my life again. Thank gosh!</p>

    <link href="http://dianapham.github.io/blog/2013/06/17/ice-cream-solves-everything/"/>
    <updated>2013-06-17T21:36:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://dianapham.github.io/blog/2013/06/17/ice-cream-solves-everything</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Biv4YvS2yyE/Ub_nQRlpf9I/AAAAAAAAC3w/G7Q5kVhIJTs/s1600/icecream.jpg" width="600"></p>

<p>One of the questions on the Code Fellows application was something like: &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the best thing ever?&rdquo; I said ice cream. I went on to talk about how walking around with an ice cream cone was the most innocent and sincere thing ever. Also, I noted how I once saw a group of bikers walking around with ice cream cones; totally all sorts of juxtaposed adorable.</p>

<p>Anyway, I made it to the final level of applications for Code Fellows; a ten minute in-person interview. I was super excited. I emailed them my availability which was basically saying I&rsquo;d take the earliest slot they had. I ended up seeing them the next day, Friday. I was really excited and amped up to talk to these guys. I really wanted to show how dedicated and driven I was for my future, but when the interview started, I totally blanked. I&rsquo;ve always wondered about how people say they&rsquo;ve never been like &ldquo;something&rdquo; before, but then for the first time they messed up or whatever. I didn&rsquo;t know what that felt like. I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;m explaining that correctly or not. But basically, I blanked out. I seriously could not articulate when they asked me to define basic programming terminologies.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>&ldquo;What is a class?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seriously!? That was one of the first things you learn! Why did I blank out? I fumbled around like I didn&rsquo;t know what I was talking about. I was embarrassed that I had just said I finished all these tracks on codecademy and took other online courses, but then I couldn&rsquo;t even explain a class. You don&rsquo;t really even have to know about programming to explain what a class is! Mathematical subsets! Animal classifications! Ach! I was disappointed in myself. I felt my confidence level dropping after that moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is an object?&rdquo;</p>

<p>OMG. Really? Yeah. I couldn&rsquo;t think. Actually, I remember thinking the word &ldquo;static&rdquo; and I think I was probably trying to reach the word &ldquo;instance&rdquo; to use that in my definition, but jeepers creepers! What was wrong with me? I tried to merge over to where I felt more comfortable with database so I thought of the objects in databases and kind of explained it like that, but man! GAH!</p>

<p>Anyway, I tried my best to keep composure. I ended up telling them a lot about myself and what I&rsquo;ve been through to get here (to Seattle, where I am today figuratively and literally). I always mentally tell myself to tone down how much I tell people about my past, but it&rsquo;s hard because my past has been such a huge factor in shaping who I am and what I do today. Isn&rsquo;t that how it is for everyone?</p>

<p>Soooo, yeah. I think it went alright, but I didn&rsquo;t feel as confident as I normally do after my interviews. Usually, I always feel like I&rsquo;m on top of the world after an interview. This was the first one that made me feeling like I knew nothing and I just embarrassed myself. Is it because I actually really really want this?</p>

<p>Notes of the interview:</p>

<pre><code>- intros
- blogs and articles
- what is a class
- what is an object
- how does the internet work?
- my code, github, octopress (what's this line? what does this mean?)
- what code to look at
- octopress - framework, only basic modifications 
- html - what is this?
- what is a stylesheet?
- why code fellows?
- education and networking
- who brought up the idea for a woman's bootcamp
- legos, buidling things, middle school, gundam
- jiu jitsu - technical explanations vs all hands-on
- women and men think differently
- good chance
- handshakes
- sunglasses
</code></pre>

<p>Man. Alright. It&rsquo;s out of my hands now.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m gonna continue trying to learn stuff on my own regardless. I&rsquo;m trying not to be too &ldquo;meh&rdquo; about it. I just don&rsquo;t understand the mindset I was in because that honestly never happened to me before. I can now understand how other people feel when they say they don&rsquo;t understand how things that never happen end up happening. More like, things NOT happening.</p>

<p>Saturday was the last day of my SQL Level 1 course at Bellevue College. It was a good class. I learned a helluva lot. I&rsquo;m super excited for the next class in the series. I really like learning SQL. It just makes sense! It&rsquo;s so intuitive. FUNSIES! I feel like a kid in class because I&rsquo;m so wide eyed curious as to what does what. It&rsquo;s great.</p>

<p>Oh, one thing I talked about during my interview was how I didn&rsquo;t have degree and how at the moment I felt like I could get along with just networking and a skills I learn on my own. Well, on my own or through different classes not necessarily from a degree track. I still get jealous and a little bitter when people talk to me about college. Just today, one of my coworkers mentioned school to me and how I should apply to all these different schools and how it would be good for me. I knew she was just trying to help, just like most people, but I can&rsquo;t shake the annoyance I always feel.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve tried very hard and am still trying very hard to get my life to go somewhere. A formal college education just hasn&rsquo;t been the most favorable route. I ran out of my money and I&rsquo;m still not old enough to apply for financial aid by myself so I can&rsquo;t do anything about that except accept it and do something else. I&rsquo;ve come to terms with just having to do something else&mdash;on my own. I wish people would respect that and just let me be. I know they don&rsquo;t mean harm, but sheesh! Give me some credit!</p>

<p>College is a touchy subject for me. /endtopic</p>

<p>Anyway, no matter what, I know I&rsquo;m amazing. I know I have a lot of potential. I know I&rsquo;ll make something of my life. I&rsquo;ve already done so much, so why stop? I&rsquo;m tired of feeling like I&rsquo;m worthless like how people used to make me feel. I don&rsquo;t need that. AIN&rsquo;T GOT NO TIME FOR THAT! I&rsquo;VE GOT ASTHMA!</p>

<p>Haha.</p>

<p>Whether I get into Code Fellows or not, I&rsquo;ll be okay. You either win or you learn!</p>

<p>I knew that would want ice cream after my interview. I didn&rsquo;t anticipate needing to be consoled, but that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s so great about ice cream; it can be eaten to celebrate or console. I got ice cream for both. To console my embarrassment, but also to celebrate the revelation of how far I&rsquo;ve already gotten in life.</p>

<p>Ice cream is the best.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been reading up on Octopress themes and whatnot because I do need to work on customizing this blog to be more &ldquo;me.&rdquo; (However, one friend did tell me so far it does look like &ldquo;me.&rdquo;) But yes, I&rsquo;ve got some ideas of what I want to do, but I&rsquo;ve been holding back on using my computer at home because my eyes are killing me. Staring at computers at work and at school for a total of eleven hours a day is the limit of what my eyes can take when they&rsquo;re all bloated. Haha, do eyes get bloated? Puffy? Regardless! Oh the agony I feel for them.</p>

<p>Yesterday, three broskis and I were causing havoc in my SQL class. We kept questioning everything the instructor was teaching. Years ago, I used to be annoyed at students who did that, however now I get it. I&rsquo;m not asking questions to be annoying, I&rsquo;m asking because I sincerely want to learn the right stuff and expand my mind. If I just sit back and absorb the material like a sponge, I&rsquo;m not going to learn as much. I&rsquo;m just learning how to regurgitate. I want to learn how to digest and utilize!</p>

<p>Basically, we were learning about INNER JOIN and during this one lab, me and the guys came up with different ways of querying the prompt. One guy wanted to bypass the middle table and go directly from one to the other. In theory, I didn&rsquo;t think this would work because the primary keys were different; I mean, that&rsquo;s kind of why there was a join table, you know? But the results showed to be the same. 17 records for both ways of querying. Long story short, we discovered that while both queries yielded 17 records, the records were different. It was pretty trippy and we tried to figure out how that happened. It was fairly simple in retrospect. We were forcing the right table to match with the left table with numbers that weren&rsquo;t necessarily supposed to match.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that makes sense. I&rsquo;m not trying to be all technical here, but the point is, I really like my class and I like to open my mouth and ask questions. In that blur of fifteen minutes were we made a mess of things, I felt like I learned so much. I wrote quick scripts to support things I said in that instance. I was a little surprised at how much I had committed to my memory already.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT blah, bloob
FROM bleh.bleepblop 
WHERE blurblah
ORDER BY bloob;
</code></pre>

<p>Super fun.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m really excited to learn all this stuff. I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m going to get into the Code Fellows bootcamp, but I seriously am committing to this stuff. I want to learn how to create websites, programs and whatnot. I really enjoy working on databases too. I&rsquo;m going to stick with this database program I&rsquo;m in whether I get into Code Fellows or not. I considered stopping the classes if I got into the bootcamp, but I think it&rsquo;ll be pretty awesome to get that the database program certificate. I&rsquo;ve already learned so much and I want more. I WANT MORE!!!</p>

<p>SQL is really fun. I like learning programming languages too, but SQL is more interesting to me. I like that I&rsquo;m given a problem and I have to figure out how to retrieve the data. I understand that programming is like that too. You have a problem and you have to solve it. What I mean is, I have been something of a secretary for all my life. I&rsquo;ve always had people telling me what they wanted and to figure out how to get whatever that is for them. At work my boss says she wants a report, she doesn&rsquo;t care how I make it or get it, as long as she has the information she wants, it&rsquo;ll be good. So yeah, it&rsquo;s like a treasure hunt! Retrieving data. Haha. I haven&rsquo;t met many people who find retrieving data fun.</p>

<p>I enjoy coding too though. It&rsquo;s a bit more dry to learn, but I love throwing lines of code together and creating things like this blog or a window with interactive circles. (Note to self: upload processing projects.)</p>

<p>Anyway, I need to go rest my eyes. Whatever pollen is out there right now is killing me. The other week there were these little white fluffy things floating around everywhere. EVERYWHERE! Oh, the horror it was!</p>

<p>Fingers crossed for the Code Fellows application!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am moments away from sending my updated application to Code Fellows. I am excited and nervous at the same time. I was in the process of getting this Octopress blog up for the past few weeks and the Code Fellows application was a huge catalyst in getting things really going.</p>

<p>So, yeah, even if I don&rsquo;t get into the women&rsquo;s bootcamp, Code Fellows has already helped me learn more about coding. YAY!</p>

<p>Wish me luck!!! :)</p>
