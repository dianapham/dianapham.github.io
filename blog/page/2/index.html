  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had a mild anxiety attack earlier. The result of that is that my upper left side is searing in pain. LAMESIES.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s something to do with an adrenaline burst, tightly contracting muscles and an abundant acid production. Meh. Alls I know is I felt this feeling for something like three years and I really don&rsquo;t want to feel it anymore.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t really feel like talking about what happened for three years. It&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;m not willing to, it&rsquo;s more like I have a ton of work I want to do so I don&rsquo;t really have time to babble one about that shit. However, I will talk a bit about what my anxiety attack was about earlier.</p>

<p>I have one friend here in Seattle that I&rsquo;d do anything for: my best friend in Seattle. He&rsquo;s my roommate now. A lot of people have claimed that we&rsquo;re dating and whatnot, but they&rsquo;re just being ignorant. I think of him as a brother. He&rsquo;s one of the first few people I met when I moved to Seattle. I didn&rsquo;t meet him right away as if I openly talked to him or anything. I actually hated him for the first year I knew him. He was such an asshole at work. But when I switched to a different department and ended up having to work with him, I realized he was a really good guy. He came off as an asshole because he needed to get his work done. And cuz &ldquo;someone&rdquo; needed to put people in their place.</p>

<p>We quickly became friends. We bonded over broski things like UFC, MMA and idiocy at work. I was sick though. I had bad mood swings. I was still trying to figure out my histamine issues. I was still getting hives and migraines. He&rsquo;d always be there though. He wouldn&rsquo;t go out of his way to comfort me, but if I ever needed help, he&rsquo;d be there. That&rsquo;s all I needed.</p>

<p>Sometimes I&rsquo;d go weeks not talking to him. Sometimes months. But everytime I reached out, he&rsquo;d be there. That&rsquo;s a lot to ask from most people. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s his apathy that allows him to be like he is or whatever, but I don&rsquo;t really think about it anymore. We&rsquo;ve been through so much in our friendship (mostly because of my drama) that we&rsquo;re just friends now. It&rsquo;s accepted that we&rsquo;re friends. Like, forever.</p>

<p>So yeah. The difference with him compared to my other friends is that he&rsquo;s anti-social and apathetic. I feel like it&rsquo;d be difficult to hang out with him or talk to him if he wasn&rsquo;t in the immediate area. So that&rsquo;s what I was panicking about. He mentioned something about moving to Oregon at the end of the year.</p>

<p>UH. NO.</p>

<p>After a lengthy conversation filled with my dramatics, I believe I secured him staying in Seattle.</p>

<p>Thank gosh.</p>

<p>But yeah, I&rsquo;m dealing with the reprecussions of my anxiety attack now. It&rsquo;s annoying, but at least in the grand scheme of things, I still have my friend.</p>

<p>Yay.</p>

Aren&rsquo;t these just adorable?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m really glad I randomly started doing pixel art again. It makes me feel like I have a chance at making that game I wanted to make years ago.</p>

<p>I wish when I had more support when I was younger to do things that I wanted. I aspired to do some many things with technology. I really wanted to get into game development, but I had no idea how to go about it. It sucks I wasn&rsquo;t persistant about it. Iono. I understand why I stopped trying though. I was tired of people using me. I knew the better I got at doing things like photo editing, the more people would make me do stuff for them.</p>

<p>My mom would always wake me up at 5 or 6 in the morning and make me edit pictures for her. It was really annoying. I&rsquo;d have to clean up the cat&rsquo;s poop and then go work for my mom. I remember always being really hungry.</p>

<p>When our computers started glitching out, I kinda just left it. I didn&rsquo;t care anymore. I didn&rsquo;t want to work for her anymore. Plus, she already told me to not get into computer work. So like, whatever right?</p>

<p>Meh.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard to be indifferent. I get so bitter and angry. I don&rsquo;t like it when I&rsquo;m like that. So I become indifferent. But that in turn comes with a price.</p>

<p>MEH.</p>

<p>Whatever. I can still do what I want. I&rsquo;m stuck there anymore.</p>

<p>On a brighter not, I finally cut my fingernails. Heyoo!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m glad I met my boyfriend and then his friends. They&rsquo;re all in game dev and it&rsquo;s just a really nice community to be associated with. I&rsquo;m like, going full circle into what I used to want to do. I guess now it&rsquo;s still what I wanna do. So yeah. YEAH.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve always been interested in pixel art. Since like iono, my elementary school years. Whenever we got our first Gameboy. Years later, I got really obsessed with Harvest Moon Friends of Mineral Town. I really wanted to create my own RPG that involved cooking. Basically everything that Harvest Moon did with their kitchen except just have the game centered around that instead of farming. I remember thinking, &ldquo;How hard is it to build a game?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hah.</p>

<p>Hah.</p>

<p>Yeah. It&rsquo;s kinda hard. I drafted the characters and environment, but I had no idea how to get anything on the computer. Like, &ldquo;programming&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t cross my mind at all. I had no idea what to do. Then freaking Cooking Mama came out and I was like, UGH.</p>

<p>I still kinda wanna make the game though. Stardew Valley is still in the development. I can&rsquo;t wait until that&rsquo;s released.</p>

<p>Anyway, here&rsquo;s another thing of pixel art I made:</p>

<p>Pretty cool, huh? :D</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My fingernails are too long. I don&rsquo;t know how most girls have such long nails. It hinders typing too much. Such a hassle it is.</p>

<p>I finally backed up my computer the other day so I&rsquo;m going to reinstall everything hopefully today or tomorrow.</p>

<p>I have 1000 buttons on the table. I think I need more. Haha. Button sales seem to be going well. A lot of customers seem to like the more down to earth characters. I&rsquo;m still contemplating the direction in which I want to lead my company. It&rsquo;s frustrating not having the support I deem necessary, but whatever. If there&rsquo;s anything about me that y&#8217;all should know, it is that I don&rsquo;t take shit from anyone. There we go, curse away.</p>

<p>I really don&rsquo;t like working for inconsiderate assholes. I kinda grew up in that sort of environment and it&rsquo;s just unnecessary. It&rsquo;s stupid. It&rsquo;s annoying. And all in all, it&rsquo;s tiring.</p>

<p>I keep having flashbacks.</p>
