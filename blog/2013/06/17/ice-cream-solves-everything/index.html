<div class="entry-content"><p><img class="center" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Biv4YvS2yyE/Ub_nQRlpf9I/AAAAAAAAC3w/G7Q5kVhIJTs/s1600/icecream.jpg" width="600"></p>

<p>One of the questions on the Code Fellows application was something like: &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the best thing ever?&rdquo; I said ice cream. I went on to talk about how walking around with an ice cream cone was the most innocent and sincere thing ever. Also, I noted how I once saw a group of bikers walking around with ice cream cones; totally all sorts of juxtaposed adorable.</p>

<p>Anyway, I made it to the final level of applications for Code Fellows; a ten minute in-person interview. I was super excited. I emailed them my availability which was basically saying I&rsquo;d take the earliest slot they had. I ended up seeing them the next day, Friday. I was really excited and amped up to talk to these guys. I really wanted to show how dedicated and driven I was for my future, but when the interview started, I totally blanked. I&rsquo;ve always wondered about how people say they&rsquo;ve never been like &ldquo;something&rdquo; before, but then for the first time they messed up or whatever. I didn&rsquo;t know what that felt like. I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;m explaining that correctly or not. But basically, I blanked out. I seriously could not articulate when they asked me to define basic programming terminologies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is a class?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seriously!? That was one of the first things you learn! Why did I blank out? I fumbled around like I didn&rsquo;t know what I was talking about. I was embarrassed that I had just said I finished all these tracks on codecademy and took other online courses, but then I couldn&rsquo;t even explain a class. You don&rsquo;t really even have to know about programming to explain what a class is! Mathematical subsets! Animal classifications! Ach! I was disappointed in myself. I felt my confidence level dropping after that moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is an object?&rdquo;</p>

<p>OMG. Really? Yeah. I couldn&rsquo;t think. Actually, I remember thinking the word &ldquo;static&rdquo; and I think I was probably trying to reach the word &ldquo;instance&rdquo; to use that in my definition, but jeepers creepers! What was wrong with me? I tried to merge over to where I felt more comfortable with database so I thought of the objects in databases and kind of explained it like that, but man! GAH!</p>

<p>Anyway, I tried my best to keep composure. I ended up telling them a lot about myself and what I&rsquo;ve been through to get here (to Seattle, where I am today figuratively and literally). I always mentally tell myself to tone down how much I tell people about my past, but it&rsquo;s hard because my past has been such a huge factor in shaping who I am and what I do today. Isn&rsquo;t that how it is for everyone?</p>

<p>Soooo, yeah. I think it went alright, but I didn&rsquo;t feel as confident as I normally do after my interviews. Usually, I always feel like I&rsquo;m on top of the world after an interview. This was the first one that made me feeling like I knew nothing and I just embarrassed myself. Is it because I actually really really want this?</p>

<p>Notes of the interview:</p>

<pre><code>- intros
- blogs and articles
- what is a class
- what is an object
- how does the internet work?
- my code, github, octopress (what's this line? what does this mean?)
- what code to look at
- octopress - framework, only basic modifications 
- html - what is this?
- what is a stylesheet?
- why code fellows?
- education and networking
- who brought up the idea for a woman's bootcamp
- legos, buidling things, middle school, gundam
- jiu jitsu - technical explanations vs all hands-on
- women and men think differently
- good chance
- handshakes
- sunglasses
</code></pre>

<p>Man. Alright. It&rsquo;s out of my hands now.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m gonna continue trying to learn stuff on my own regardless. I&rsquo;m trying not to be too &ldquo;meh&rdquo; about it. I just don&rsquo;t understand the mindset I was in because that honestly never happened to me before. I can now understand how other people feel when they say they don&rsquo;t understand how things that never happen end up happening. More like, things NOT happening.</p>

<p>Saturday was the last day of my SQL Level 1 course at Bellevue College. It was a good class. I learned a helluva lot. I&rsquo;m super excited for the next class in the series. I really like learning SQL. It just makes sense! It&rsquo;s so intuitive. FUNSIES! I feel like a kid in class because I&rsquo;m so wide eyed curious as to what does what. It&rsquo;s great.</p>

<p>Oh, one thing I talked about during my interview was how I didn&rsquo;t have degree and how at the moment I felt like I could get along with just networking and a skills I learn on my own. Well, on my own or through different classes not necessarily from a degree track. I still get jealous and a little bitter when people talk to me about college. Just today, one of my coworkers mentioned school to me and how I should apply to all these different schools and how it would be good for me. I knew she was just trying to help, just like most people, but I can&rsquo;t shake the annoyance I always feel.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve tried very hard and am still trying very hard to get my life to go somewhere. A formal college education just hasn&rsquo;t been the most favorable route. I ran out of my money and I&rsquo;m still not old enough to apply for financial aid by myself so I can&rsquo;t do anything about that except accept it and do something else. I&rsquo;ve come to terms with just having to do something else&mdash;on my own. I wish people would respect that and just let me be. I know they don&rsquo;t mean harm, but sheesh! Give me some credit!</p>

<p>College is a touchy subject for me. /endtopic</p>

<p>Anyway, no matter what, I know I&rsquo;m amazing. I know I have a lot of potential. I know I&rsquo;ll make something of my life. I&rsquo;ve already done so much, so why stop? I&rsquo;m tired of feeling like I&rsquo;m worthless like how people used to make me feel. I don&rsquo;t need that. AIN&rsquo;T GOT NO TIME FOR THAT! I&rsquo;VE GOT ASTHMA!</p>

<p>Haha.</p>

<p>Whether I get into Code Fellows or not, I&rsquo;ll be okay. You either win or you learn!</p>

<p>I knew that would want ice cream after my interview. I didn&rsquo;t anticipate needing to be consoled, but that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s so great about ice cream; it can be eaten to celebrate or console. I got ice cream for both. To console my embarrassment, but also to celebrate the revelation of how far I&rsquo;ve already gotten in life.</p>

<p>Ice cream is the best.</p>
