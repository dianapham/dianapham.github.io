<div class="entry-content"><p>My fingernails are too long. I don&rsquo;t know how most girls have such long nails. It hinders typing too much. Such a hassle it is.</p>

<p>I finally backed up my computer the other day so I&rsquo;m going to reinstall everything hopefully today or tomorrow.</p>

<p>I have 1000 buttons on the table. I think I need more. Haha. Button sales seem to be going well. A lot of customers seem to like the more down to earth characters. I&rsquo;m still contemplating the direction in which I want to lead my company. It&rsquo;s frustrating not having the support I deem necessary, but whatever. If there&rsquo;s anything about me that y&#8217;all should know, it is that I don&rsquo;t take shit from anyone. There we go, curse away.</p>

<p>I really don&rsquo;t like working for inconsiderate assholes. I kinda grew up in that sort of environment and it&rsquo;s just unnecessary. It&rsquo;s stupid. It&rsquo;s annoying. And all in all, it&rsquo;s tiring.</p>

<p>I keep having flashbacks.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I&rsquo;ve contemplated whether I still want to keep this blog as just a tech-related blog or not. Whatever. I want people to know who I am. I don&rsquo;t see myself trying to apply to any big companies anytime soon. And if I ever do and they pass me cuz of what I write here, then whatever. I&rsquo;m kind of beyond the point of dealing with people who don&rsquo;t care about me and don&rsquo;t give me a chance. I will work my ass off for whatever I care about. But you know, that&rsquo;s the thing. I have to care first. So if you don&rsquo;t care about me then I&rsquo;m not going to care about you.</p>

<p>My mom once told me that if I wanted respect, I had to respect people first. She told me this while we were in her car on the driveway of our house. She was in the driver seat as I was in the back seat behind the passenger seat. The passenger seat was always full of papers. Painting the picture of the scene doesn&rsquo;t do much for this particular story, but it helps me remember. I&rsquo;ve been pushing everything back way too much. I need to let it out now. Cuz you know, I need therapy.</p>

<p>Anyway. There we were in driveway. We were about to leave to this Sunday Vietnamese School that she taught at. I took classes at this school, but seriously? I did not understand the language. I failed so many classes. She always asked the teachers to let me go on and that she&rsquo;d &ldquo;help&rdquo; me. Meh. I still failed. Eventually, I wasn&rsquo;t allowed to move up unless I actually passed and iono. It was agonizing. All these other little kids would pass and a fresh batch of kids would enter while I stayed. I felt so dumb. The problem was that they spoke the language at home so they understood all these words. I didn&rsquo;t. I could read and write, but comprehension was out the window.</p>

<p>I keep going on all these tangents. My writing kind of sucks now. MEH.</p>

<p>Whatever. Basically, I fumbled my way through all the grades and eventually made it to the last grade; the class that my mom taught. WELL! She said there was no way I was going to pass her class so I had to go up to the office to work for all the teachers. Oh great. Yeah, lemme go ahead and copy all the homework for the whole school in two hours. Lemme make y&#8217;all tea. Yeah, okay, I&rsquo;ll set out your food and clean up after you. Okay, I&rsquo;ll make sure all your supplies are in stock and clean. Okay, I&rsquo;ll go deliver all these papers and talk to people in a mangled version of your language so they&rsquo;ll get mad at me and call me stupid.</p>

<p>People always thought I was bitter and angry. Fuck yeah I was bitter and angry. But I was also fucking sad. I felt pathetic.</p>

<p>One day, I was sitting in front of stacks of papers that were supposed to go out to every class in the school. Some teacher came over and asked me in their language, &ldquo;Do we have to organize these papers?&rdquo; I was trying to form the words to say, &ldquo;I already organized them.&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t want to sound stupid so I took care to form the sentence in my mind before I said it. It look like ten seconds for each word. But no. Don&rsquo;t give me any goddamn time to not sound dumb. Go ahead and call me dumb. And angry. And worthless. Yes, I fucking organized those three hundred pieces of paper. Fuck you. You go pass them out.</p>

<p>Respect. &ldquo;You have to respect people if you want them to respect you.&rdquo; Doesn&rsquo;t it work the other way too? No one respected me so why did I have to respect them? I don&rsquo;t care if they were older or had &ldquo;higher positions.&rdquo; If you treat me like shit, I&rsquo;m not going to like you. Why should I respect you? Wasn&rsquo;t it enough I was your little bitch? Your &ldquo;office assistant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m still fucking bitter. People tell me it&rsquo;s over. That I don&rsquo;t have to think about it anymore. Well that&rsquo;s not true. I fucking remember it every single night. I cry and hide in closets. In two weeks, I&rsquo;m going to turn 24. Aren&rsquo;t I an adult? Why do I still feel like a child?</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know what I ever did to make people not like me. I always did what I was told. Was it a misunderstanding? Fuck yeah it was. Thanks for not trying to help me though.</p>

<p>I feel something boiling inside. I haven&rsquo;t felt it in years because I shoved it down to survive. I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m going to explode.</p>

<p>I think the point of all that was that if someone reads all and doesn&rsquo;t want to work with me then whatever. I really don&rsquo;t care. Culture fit is important to me. Being human is important to me. Keeping it real and all that.</p>

<p>When I give talks and stuff, I allude to how I had a rough childhood. I mumble something about how I&rsquo;m an angry person and everyone chuckles. It&rsquo;s pretty funny. I usually chuckle too. I really admire people who go through hardships and make the most of them. That&rsquo;s what I try to do all the time. I try to joke about things that happen. I use humor to handle everything. Sometimes it&rsquo;s too sarcastic and dry for people. Too much dark humor for the general public. But I need it. And I need to vent.</p>

<p>I really don&rsquo;t want to blow up.</p>

<p>So yeah. Here&rsquo;s me trying to reset again. To move on the correct way. Dealing with my issues instead of shoving them down. Three years ago, it was what I needed. I knew it&rsquo;d come back and haunt me. But I needed to survive. I couldn&rsquo;t deal with my past. Now that I&rsquo;m &ldquo;surviving,&rdquo; all of the past is crawling up to reach me. I&rsquo;m done just surviving. I think it&rsquo;s time to live.</p>

<p>Man, that got all mushy there didn&rsquo;t it? Gross.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m proud of everything I&rsquo;ve accomplished. I&rsquo;ve met a ton of awesome people. I want to keep meeting awesome people. I want to excel at everything I do just like I have been. I&rsquo;ve proven I can make it. Fuck the past. It wants to creept up so I&rsquo;ll throw it all out there, but after that I&rsquo;m gonna be all like, &ldquo;yo man, you had your time. get outta hurr.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m so lame sometimes. el oh el oh el.</p>

<p>Okay. Bye.</p>
