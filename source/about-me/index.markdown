Greetings!

This is the about me page. By me, I mean, me, Diana. The Diana who is pretty damn awesome. Some say conceitedness is a bad thing. I dunno, I guess it's a bad thing if you're being pretentious; I'm just stating facts. 

Lolsicles.

Anywho, again, my name is Diana. I'm a self-starter and I drink a lot of water. 

I started this blog because:

1. It gets to a point in every one of my personal blogs where things start getting dark and bitter (mostly because of my past). My last blog was getting to that point and I knew it was a chapter of my life that needed to end. 

2. I've used a bunch of different blog sites: xanga, tumblr, wordpress, blogspot and etc... And well, I wanted to venture into something more exciting and challenging rather than just signing up for another site. It was too easy, you know? The thought of learning a bit of coding to get this octopress blog running was very appealing to me. It was a challenge, but quite fulfilling in the end. 

3. So yeah, I wanted to create a blog from scratch (I'm using the octopress framework, but that's from scratch enough for me right now)

4. I wanted to start writing a blog that focused on one main theme as opposed to the daily happenings of my life. (Btw, if you haven't guessed this blog is totally informal.) I'm entering the more techy phase of my life so this blog will invoke more technical aspects of my happenings rather than my older blogs where I'd talk about the asinine unfortunate things that happened to me/around me/at me. 

5. BECAUSE I THOUGHT I COULD AND WOULD DO SOMETHING WITH MY LIFE. [more on this later]

I like to write lists, however they generally turn into paragraphs of their own. 

I'll make this about me section better when I have more time. I hesitate to go on a spiel about my past. It's not because it's not fascinating, oh ho ho, it is. It's full of crazy things that makes me stop and think, "Did that really happen to me? Wait, yes it did." I hesitate because I tend to ramble too long and then get into a horrible place in my mind and I just don't want to deal with that right now. 

At this current moment in time, July 16, 2013 8:42am, I am feeling good. Content. Sometimes even really happy. That's a good place to be. It's something I'm not used to so I'm not going to question it or do anything to make me go backwards. I hate going backwards. 

So instead of writing about my past here are some of my interests: cats, databases, SQL, programming, ruby, ruby on rails, jigsaw puzzles, making fun of people, painting, flash animations, excel, ms access, climbing, parkour, running, 5k-10k's, brazilian jiu jitsu, ufc, basketball, writing melodies, singing, dancing, ballroom dancing, guitar, cereal, breaking stuff to put it back together, daydreaming, wishing it would snow, going off on a tangent.

Hokay! See y'all later. Enjoy the site!
