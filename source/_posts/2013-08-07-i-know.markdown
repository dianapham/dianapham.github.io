Yes, yes. I know I need to update my blog more. Code Fellows is pretty intense. Oh, am I listing excuses? I hate listing excuses. I'll call them "better use of my time at the current phase of my life":

1. code fellows - learning all the time + projects = not a lot of time
2. work - I NEED TO EAT SO I HAVE TO WORK!
3. the heat - histamine overload. always have to make sure my body temperature doesn't go chaotic and make me sick. damn the sun!

So yeah, in text that doesn't sound like much and I really should be able to get a short blurb out here and there. But I guess it's also that I really want to change this layout. Ughhh. I'll do that this weekend. Probably. Maybe. I dunno. 

Also, the custom domain thing is killing me. It takes too long to load. Uber frustrating. 

Until the next time I actually post. HUZZAH!
