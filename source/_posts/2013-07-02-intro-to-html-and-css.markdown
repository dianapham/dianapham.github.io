I'm starting my Intro to HTML & CSS course today. SUPER EXCITED! 

We have to come prepared with materials for a mock website. It's just for funsies so I'm going to create a website compiling all my cartoon drawings. I was thinking I'd just include all of my artsy stuff, but nah. The simple cartoon idea will be enough for class and I'll just implement everything I learn into making this blog better. I'd rather just have one site for now. You know, make one site look hella good. 

I'm still fumbling around with the code fellows HTML problem. UGH. I can't get the append function to work the way I want it to. Hopefully, I'll learn about it or can ask someone about it in the HTML class I take tonight.

Here's the most recent cartoon I drew at work:

I need to get a new phone. Apparently, I'm not receiving incoming calls and my text messages aren't going out. Boo. Plus, the camera is getting iffy. BLAH. I've gotta save up though. 

OH! I totally had $5.30 surplus from my little budget experiment. Bwahaha! I'm so good at budgeting. The last thing I bought in June was food for this week. Oh the things I can get with $5.30. That's like, a whole 'nother week of food almost! Cheap asian produce market ftw!

I'm at the class right now and I feel so...cool. Haha. :)

Like, there are all these women here with their laptops setup and ready to learn this techy stuff. YAY!

I feel like I'm a part of something and it's nice. Huzzah!
