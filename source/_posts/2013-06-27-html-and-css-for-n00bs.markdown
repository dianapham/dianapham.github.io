Earlier this morning, I got an email from Code Fellows saying I'm in the "*final pool*" of applications. They'll be deciding next week who gets in. Oh man, the past week has been so stressful with regards to Code Fellows. The past month if anything!

The challenge questions they sent were fairly simple in theory, as in I understood what they wanted, but in practice...AGHH!! I realized early on that I totally did not know enough to do any of the problems so I did what I do best which is to self teach. My eyes have been killing me the past week because of how much I've been reading. 

Between work, school and lack of technical skills, I asked for an extension on the time the problems were to be due and they said that was fine. Often times, I'd feel bad that I was taking so long to get the stuff done, but man! I really don't know this stuff! I'm trying really hard to get it all done though. I'm almost there. The first question using Ruby is done. The HTML one is still troubling me. 

Right after I got the email from Code Fellows this morning, I got an email from this women's tech meetup. The subject was "Intro to HTML and CSS." I read the subject and was like, "OMG THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I NEED RIGHT NOW!" Unfortunately, I need it now instead of next week when the classes are offered, but I signed up anyway. It's a 4 class series. I think it'll be beneficial. The email said only 5 spots were left. When I finally got around to checking it out, there was only 1 spot left. I took it. 

So yeah. I'm gonna be doing that for the month of July on Tuesday nights. DB classes Monday and Wednesday nights. If I get into Code Fellows, it'll be M-F 9am-4pm. I think I read that some people stay after 4pm to work on stuff, but I really want to finish my DB classes. I really enjoy them. 

Okay, back to learning more about HTML. At least enough to finish this problem!
