Is it summer yet? Nevertheless, spring/summer weather does crazy things to me. I've had horrible allergies for the past three days. It hurts to keep them open. Alas, I must keep them open! There are too many beautiful things to discover and explore. Like coding!

I've been reading up on Octopress themes and whatnot because I do need to work on customizing this blog to be more "me." (However, one friend did tell me so far it does look like "me.") But yes, I've got some ideas of what I want to do, but I've been holding back on using my computer at home because my eyes are killing me. Staring at computers at work and at school for a total of eleven hours a day is the limit of what my eyes can take when they're all bloated. Haha, do eyes get bloated? Puffy? Regardless! Oh the agony I feel for them. 

Yesterday, three broskis and I were causing havoc in my SQL class. We kept questioning everything the instructor was teaching. Years ago, I used to be annoyed at students who did that, however now I get it. I'm not asking questions to be annoying, I'm asking because I sincerely want to learn the right stuff and expand my mind. If I just sit back and absorb the material like a sponge, I'm not going to learn as much. I'm just learning how to regurgitate. I want to learn how to digest and utilize!

Basically, we were learning about INNER JOIN and during this one lab, me and the guys came up with different ways of querying the prompt. One guy wanted to bypass the middle table and go directly from one to the other. In theory, I didn't think this would work because the primary keys were different; I mean, that's kind of why there was a join table, you know? But the results showed to be the same. 17 records for both ways of querying. Long story short, we discovered that while both queries yielded 17 records, the records were different. It was pretty trippy and we tried to figure out how that happened. It was fairly simple in retrospect. We were forcing the right table to match with the left table with numbers that weren't necessarily supposed to match. 

I don't know if that makes sense. I'm not trying to be all technical here, but the point is, I really like my class and I like to open my mouth and ask questions. In that blur of fifteen minutes were we made a mess of things, I felt like I learned so much. I wrote quick scripts to support things I said in that instance. I was a little surprised at how much I had committed to my memory already. 

	SELECT blah, bloob
	FROM bleh.bleepblop 
	WHERE blurblah
	ORDER BY bloob;

Super fun.

I'm really excited to learn all this stuff. I don't know if I'm going to get into the Code Fellows bootcamp, but I seriously am committing to this stuff. I want to learn how to create websites, programs and whatnot. I really enjoy working on databases too. I'm going to stick with this database program I'm in whether I get into Code Fellows or not. I considered stopping the classes if I got into the bootcamp, but I think it'll be pretty awesome to get that the database program certificate. I've already learned so much and I want more. I WANT MORE!!!

SQL is really fun. I like learning programming languages too, but SQL is more interesting to me. I like that I'm given a problem and I have to figure out how to retrieve the data. I understand that programming is like that too. You have a problem and you have to solve it. What I mean is, I have been something of a secretary for all my life. I've always had people telling me what they wanted and to figure out how to get whatever that is for them. At work my boss says she wants a report, she doesn't care how I make it or get it, as long as she has the information she wants, it'll be good. So yeah, it's like a treasure hunt! Retrieving data. Haha. I haven't met many people who find retrieving data fun. 

I enjoy coding too though. It's a bit more dry to learn, but I love throwing lines of code together and creating things like this blog or a window with interactive circles. (Note to self: upload processing projects.)

Anyway, I need to go rest my eyes. Whatever pollen is out there right now is killing me. The other week there were these little white fluffy things floating around everywhere. EVERYWHERE! Oh, the horror it was! 

Fingers crossed for the Code Fellows application!
