Currently, I have 50 bucks in my wallet. My goal for the rest of the month is not to spend any money at all (besides automatic payments for bills) and if I really have to, then that 50 bucks in my wallet will be my fund. I mean, I'll still have my debit and credit cards, but I really want to see if I can do this. I used to live off of so little and now that I'm more financially secure, I've been splurging on going out to eat with people. 

Actually, yeah this monetary limitation will help with my diet because I've been eating out way too much and getting hives. I'll have to dedicate a page to my histamine intolerance. 

To do list for this blog:

	- landing page (index)
	- change the font to the post titles
	- add youtube plugin
	- add disqus account
	- page: singing videos
	- page: art projects 
	- page: histamine intolerance
	- change domain
	- twitter? (eh, I don't use it that much)

That's it so far. 

Even though I didn't code this whole blog from scratch on my own (totally don't know enough to do that right now), I definitely do find joy and fulfillment in learning how to change the code as I please. Yay for technology!

But yeah, it'd be so ballin' if I get into Code Fellows (I should hear back from them by the end of this week or early next week whether I get in or not). If I don't get in, then I'm gonna really focus on learning more database and programming. Also, I'm getting my diet straightened out so I need to really stick with that so I don't get sick so much. AND I renewed my membership for climbing so I gotta get my butt out to go exercise. 

Ultimate frisbee this evening!

I'm gaining control of my life again. Thank gosh!
