One of the questions on the Code Fellows application was something like: "what's the best thing ever?" I said ice cream. I went on to talk about how walking around with an ice cream cone was the most innocent and sincere thing ever. Also, I noted how I once saw a group of bikers walking around with ice cream cones; totally all sorts of juxtaposed adorable. 

Anyway, I made it to the final level of applications for Code Fellows; a ten minute in-person interview. I was super excited. I emailed them my availability which was basically saying I'd take the earliest slot they had. I ended up seeing them the next day, Friday. I was really excited and amped up to talk to these guys. I really wanted to show how dedicated and driven I was for my future, but when the interview started, I totally blanked. I've always wondered about how people say they've never been like "something" before, but then for the first time they messed up or whatever. I didn't know what that felt like. I'm not sure if I'm explaining that correctly or not. But basically, I blanked out. I seriously could not articulate when they asked me to define basic programming terminologies.

"What is a class?"

Seriously!? That was one of the first things you learn! Why did I blank out? I fumbled around like I didn't know what I was talking about. I was embarrassed that I had just said I finished all these tracks on codecademy and took other online courses, but then I couldn't even explain a class. You don't really even have to know about programming to explain what a class is! Mathematical subsets! Animal classifications! Ach! I was disappointed in myself. I felt my confidence level dropping after that moment. 

"What is an object?"

OMG. Really? Yeah. I couldn't think. Actually, I remember thinking the word "static" and I think I was probably trying to reach the word "instance" to use that in my definition, but jeepers creepers! What was wrong with me? I tried to merge over to where I felt more comfortable with database so I thought of the objects in databases and kind of explained it like that, but man! GAH!

Anyway, I tried my best to keep composure. I ended up telling them a lot about myself and what I've been through to get here (to Seattle, where I am today figuratively and literally). I always mentally tell myself to tone down how much I tell people about my past, but it's hard because my past has been such a huge factor in shaping who I am and what I do today. Isn't that how it is for everyone? 

Soooo, yeah. I think it went alright, but I didn't feel as confident as I normally do after my interviews. Usually, I always feel like I'm on top of the world after an interview. This was the first one that made me feeling like I knew nothing and I just embarrassed myself. Is it because I actually really really want this?

Notes of the interview:

	- intros
	- blogs and articles
	- what is a class
	- what is an object
	- how does the internet work?
	- my code, github, octopress (what's this line? what does this mean?)
	- what code to look at
	- octopress - framework, only basic modifications 
	- html - what is this?
	- what is a stylesheet?
	- why code fellows?
	- education and networking
	- who brought up the idea for a woman's bootcamp
	- legos, buidling things, middle school, gundam
	- jiu jitsu - technical explanations vs all hands-on
	- women and men think differently
	- good chance
	- handshakes
	- sunglasses

Man. Alright. It's out of my hands now.

I'm gonna continue trying to learn stuff on my own regardless. I'm trying not to be too "meh" about it. I just don't understand the mindset I was in because that honestly never happened to me before. I can now understand how other people feel when they say they don't understand how things that never happen end up happening. More like, things NOT happening. 

Saturday was the last day of my SQL Level 1 course at Bellevue College. It was a good class. I learned a helluva lot. I'm super excited for the next class in the series. I really like learning SQL. It just makes sense! It's so intuitive. FUNSIES! I feel like a kid in class because I'm so wide eyed curious as to what does what. It's great. 

Oh, one thing I talked about during my interview was how I didn't have degree and how at the moment I felt like I could get along with just networking and a skills I learn on my own. Well, on my own or through different classes not necessarily from a degree track. I still get jealous and a little bitter when people talk to me about college. Just today, one of my coworkers mentioned school to me and how I should apply to all these different schools and how it would be good for me. I knew she was just trying to help, just like most people, but I can't shake the annoyance I always feel. 

I've tried very hard and am still trying very hard to get my life to go somewhere. A formal college education just hasn't been the most favorable route. I ran out of my money and I'm still not old enough to apply for financial aid by myself so I can't do anything about that except accept it and do something else. I've come to terms with just having to do something else--on my own. I wish people would respect that and just let me be. I know they don't mean harm, but sheesh! Give me some credit!

College is a touchy subject for me. /endtopic

Anyway, no matter what, I know I'm amazing. I know I have a lot of potential. I know I'll make something of my life. I've already done so much, so why stop? I'm tired of feeling like I'm worthless like how people used to make me feel. I don't need that. AIN'T GOT NO TIME FOR THAT! I'VE GOT ASTHMA! 

Haha.

Whether I get into Code Fellows or not, I'll be okay. You either win or you learn!

I knew that would want ice cream after my interview. I didn't anticipate needing to be consoled, but that's what's so great about ice cream; it can be eaten to celebrate or console. I got ice cream for both. To console my embarrassment, but also to celebrate the revelation of how far I've already gotten in life. 

Ice cream is the best.
