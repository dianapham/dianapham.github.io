I feel like all my posts pretty much start with the effect of, "omg it's been forever since I've posted!"

Meh.

The other day, it was brought to my attention that I haven't been writing much anymore. Back in the day, I used to write 8 pages of daily ramblings for something like 7 years? Back when Xanga was a really cool thing that everyone wrote on. I didn't have many followers, nor did I really follow anyone. But I really enjoyed writing. I didn't really know if anyone read my stuff, but it was super cathartic, so I kept it up. Sometimes I feel like I stopped writing because I get so OCD about it all. If I don't write one day then I get really stressed out that I didn't write and then I feel all bad and gross. No bueno.

In any case, I originally meant for this blog to be about tech related stuff, but I really don't like scoping that much. I need a place to just talk about anything. Since Xanga doesn't seem to be up anymore, I looked at other blogging platforms and just got frustrated. So here I am again. I'll write about whatever is on my mind. I really don't think many people are going to read this stuff anyway. Whatevs.

I'm working on my Rad Randy app for DinoHulk. Freaking error is driving me crazy:

"Application windows are expected to have a root view controller at the end of application launch"

UGHHHH. I'll figure it out tomorrow. BLEH.

I'm going to make an effort at making this blog better. I guess I want to have it be my personal website too. Blah blah. Grumble ramble.
