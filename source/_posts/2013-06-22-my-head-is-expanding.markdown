Seriously, I feel like my brain is pushing against my skull. I'm soaking in so much information right now. I told someone I'm "drying my eyes out" trying to learn ruby and html.

Yesterday, I received a message about scholarships for Code Fellows if I got into the program. I sent answers to the scholarship questions then this morning I received another message about final application questions. More like, final application problems. I have to create some stuff and holy moly bologna! The things I have to make are a little beyond my scope, but I mean, that's kind of what's making this all so fun. I'm learning all this crazy shizzniz.

I've been getting really frustrated trying to figure these things out, but I think ten hours later, I'm really getting somewhere. There are three problems and I've pretty much got all of them half done. I think that's a good start! Haha. In theory, I know what I need to do, it's just making it all be real that I'm working on. If I could use MS Access or better yet, SQL Server, I could get all this done pretty quickly, but I've gotta build it all from scratch so yeah. That's the point! To learn! 

Something I've learned about myself is that my frustration dances and my success dances are pretty much the same; the only differences are my facial expressions. I jump up and down, express obscenities, thrash my limbs around, it looks like I'm squinting in both dances. In my frustrated dance, I glare at everything. In my success dance I'm smiling. Haha. I think I can model that! But I'll do that a little later. I gotta finish these things. 

Huzzahhh!
