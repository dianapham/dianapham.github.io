I am moments away from sending my updated application to Code Fellows. I am excited and nervous at the same time. I was in the process of getting this Octopress blog up for the past few weeks and the Code Fellows application was a huge catalyst in getting things really going. 

So, yeah, even if I don't get into the women's bootcamp, Code Fellows has already helped me learn more about coding. YAY!

Wish me luck!!! :)
