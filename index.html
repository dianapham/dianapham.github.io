  <div class="entry-content"><p>Earlier this morning, I got an email from Code Fellows saying I&rsquo;m in the &ldquo;<em>final pool</em>&rdquo; of applications. They&rsquo;ll be deciding next week who gets in. Oh man, the past week has been so stressful with regards to Code Fellows. The past month if anything!</p>

<p>The challenge questions they sent were fairly simple in theory, as in I understood what they wanted, but in practice&hellip;AGHH!! I realized early on that I totally did not know enough to do any of the problems so I did what I do best which is to self teach. My eyes have been killing me the past week because of how much I&rsquo;ve been reading.</p>

<p>Between work, school and lack of technical skills, I asked for an extension on the time the problems were to be due and they said that was fine. Often times, I&rsquo;d feel bad that I was taking so long to get the stuff done, but man! I really don&rsquo;t know this stuff! I&rsquo;m trying really hard to get it all done though. I&rsquo;m almost there. The first question using Ruby is done. The HTML one is still troubling me.</p>

<p>Right after I got the email from Code Fellows this morning, I got an email from this women&rsquo;s tech meetup. The subject was &ldquo;Intro to HTML and CSS.&rdquo; I read the subject and was like, &ldquo;OMG THAT&rsquo;S EXACTLY WHAT I NEED RIGHT NOW!&rdquo; Unfortunately, I need it now instead of next week when the classes are offered, but I signed up anyway. It&rsquo;s a 4 class series. I think it&rsquo;ll be beneficial. The email said only 5 spots were left. When I finally got around to checking it out, there was only 1 spot left. I took it.</p>

<p>So yeah. I&rsquo;m gonna be doing that for the month of July on Tuesday nights. DB classes Monday and Wednesday nights. If I get into Code Fellows, it&rsquo;ll be M-F 9am-4pm. I think I read that some people stay after 4pm to work on stuff, but I really want to finish my DB classes. I really enjoy them.</p>

<p>Okay, back to learning more about HTML. At least enough to finish this problem!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Seriously, I feel like my brain is pushing against my skull. I&rsquo;m soaking in so much information right now. I told someone I&rsquo;m &ldquo;drying my eyes out&rdquo; trying to learn ruby and html.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I received a message about scholarships for Code Fellows if I got into the program. I sent answers to the scholarship questions then this morning I received another message about final application questions. More like, final application problems. I have to create some stuff and holy moly bologna! The things I have to make are a little beyond my scope, but I mean, that&rsquo;s kind of what&rsquo;s making this all so fun. I&rsquo;m learning all this crazy shizzniz.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been getting really frustrated trying to figure these things out, but I think ten hours later, I&rsquo;m really getting somewhere. There are three problems and I&rsquo;ve pretty much got all of them half done. I think that&rsquo;s a good start! Haha. In theory, I know what I need to do, it&rsquo;s just making it all be real that I&rsquo;m working on. If I could use MS Access or better yet, SQL Server, I could get all this done pretty quickly, but I&rsquo;ve gotta build it all from scratch so yeah. That&rsquo;s the point! To learn!</p>

<p>Something I&rsquo;ve learned about myself is that my frustration dances and my success dances are pretty much the same; the only differences are my facial expressions. I jump up and down, express obscenities, thrash my limbs around, it looks like I&rsquo;m squinting in both dances. In my frustrated dance, I glare at everything. In my success dance I&rsquo;m smiling. Haha. I think I can model that! But I&rsquo;ll do that a little later. I gotta finish these things.</p>

<p>Huzzahhh!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Currently, I have 50 bucks in my wallet. My goal for the rest of the month is not to spend any money at all (besides automatic payments for bills) and if I really have to, then that 50 bucks in my wallet will be my fund. I mean, I&rsquo;ll still have my debit and credit cards, but I really want to see if I can do this. I used to live off of so little and now that I&rsquo;m more financially secure, I&rsquo;ve been splurging on going out to eat with people.</p>

<p>Actually, yeah this monetary limitation will help with my diet because I&rsquo;ve been eating out way too much and getting hives. I&rsquo;ll have to dedicate a page to my histamine intolerance.</p>

<p>To do list for this blog:</p>

<pre><code>- landing page (index)
- change the font to the post titles
- add youtube plugin
- add disqus account
- page: singing videos
- page: art projects 
- page: histamine intolerance
- change domain
- twitter? (eh, I don't use it that much)
</code></pre>

<p>That&rsquo;s it so far.</p>

<p>Even though I didn&rsquo;t code this whole blog from scratch on my own (totally don&rsquo;t know enough to do that right now), I definitely do find joy and fulfillment in learning how to change the code as I please. Yay for technology!</p>

<p>But yeah, it&rsquo;d be so ballin&#8217; if I get into Code Fellows (I should hear back from them by the end of this week or early next week whether I get in or not). If I don&rsquo;t get in, then I&rsquo;m gonna really focus on learning more database and programming. Also, I&rsquo;m getting my diet straightened out so I need to really stick with that so I don&rsquo;t get sick so much. AND I renewed my membership for climbing so I gotta get my butt out to go exercise.</p>

<p>Ultimate frisbee this evening!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m gaining control of my life again. Thank gosh!</p>

<p>One of the questions on the Code Fellows application was something like: &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the best thing ever?&rdquo; I said ice cream. I went on to talk about how walking around with an ice cream cone was the most innocent and sincere thing ever. Also, I noted how I once saw a group of bikers walking around with ice cream cones; totally all sorts of juxtaposed adorable.</p>

<p>Anyway, I made it to the final level of applications for Code Fellows; a ten minute in-person interview. I was super excited. I emailed them my availability which was basically saying I&rsquo;d take the earliest slot they had. I ended up seeing them the next day, Friday. I was really excited and amped up to talk to these guys. I really wanted to show how dedicated and driven I was for my future, but when the interview started, I totally blanked. I&rsquo;ve always wondered about how people say they&rsquo;ve never been like &ldquo;something&rdquo; before, but then for the first time they messed up or whatever. I didn&rsquo;t know what that felt like. I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;m explaining that correctly or not. But basically, I blanked out. I seriously could not articulate when they asked me to define basic programming terminologies.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Is it summer yet? Nevertheless, spring/summer weather does crazy things to me. I&rsquo;ve had horrible allergies for the past three days. It hurts to keep them open. Alas, I must keep them open! There are too many beautiful things to discover and explore. Like coding!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been reading up on Octopress themes and whatnot because I do need to work on customizing this blog to be more &ldquo;me.&rdquo; (However, one friend did tell me so far it does look like &ldquo;me.&rdquo;) But yes, I&rsquo;ve got some ideas of what I want to do, but I&rsquo;ve been holding back on using my computer at home because my eyes are killing me. Staring at computers at work and at school for a total of eleven hours a day is the limit of what my eyes can take when they&rsquo;re all bloated. Haha, do eyes get bloated? Puffy? Regardless! Oh the agony I feel for them.</p>

<p>Yesterday, three broskis and I were causing havoc in my SQL class. We kept questioning everything the instructor was teaching. Years ago, I used to be annoyed at students who did that, however now I get it. I&rsquo;m not asking questions to be annoying, I&rsquo;m asking because I sincerely want to learn the right stuff and expand my mind. If I just sit back and absorb the material like a sponge, I&rsquo;m not going to learn as much. I&rsquo;m just learning how to regurgitate. I want to learn how to digest and utilize!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am moments away from sending my updated application to Code Fellows. I am excited and nervous at the same time. I was in the process of getting this Octopress blog up for the past few weeks and the Code Fellows application was a huge catalyst in getting things really going.</p>

<p>So, yeah, even if I don&rsquo;t get into the women&rsquo;s bootcamp, Code Fellows has already helped me learn more about coding. YAY!</p>

<p>Wish me luck!!! :)</p>
