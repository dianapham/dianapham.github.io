  <div class="entry-content"><p>I feel like all my posts pretty much start with the effect of, &ldquo;omg it&rsquo;s been forever since I&rsquo;ve posted!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meh.</p>

<p>The other day, it was brought to my attention that I haven&rsquo;t been writing much anymore. Back in the day, I used to write 8 pages of daily ramblings for something like 7 years? Back when Xanga was a really cool thing that everyone wrote on. I didn&rsquo;t have many followers, nor did I really follow anyone. But I really enjoyed writing. I didn&rsquo;t really know if anyone read my stuff, but it was super cathartic, so I kept it up. Sometimes I feel like I stopped writing because I get so OCD about it all. If I don&rsquo;t write one day then I get really stressed out that I didn&rsquo;t write and then I feel all bad and gross. No bueno.</p>

<p>In any case, I originally meant for this blog to be about tech related stuff, but I really don&rsquo;t like scoping that much. I need a place to just talk about anything. Since Xanga doesn&rsquo;t seem to be up anymore, I looked at other blogging platforms and just got frustrated. So here I am again. I&rsquo;ll write about whatever is on my mind. I really don&rsquo;t think many people are going to read this stuff anyway. Whatevs.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m working on my Rad Randy app for DinoHulk. Freaking error is driving me crazy:</p>

<p>\ts&#8221;Application windows are expected to have a root view controller at the end of application launch&#8221;</p>

<p>UGHHHH. I&rsquo;ll figure it out tomorrow. BLEH.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to make an effort at making this blog better. I guess I want to have it be my personal website too. Blah blah. Grumble ramble.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yes, yes. I know I need to update my blog more. Code Fellows is pretty intense. Oh, am I listing excuses? I hate listing excuses. I&rsquo;ll call them &ldquo;better use of my time at the current phase of my life&rdquo;:</p>

<ol>
<li>code fellows &ndash; learning all the time + projects = not a lot of time</li>
<li>work &ndash; I NEED TO EAT SO I HAVE TO WORK!</li>
<li>the heat &ndash; histamine overload. always have to make sure my body temperature doesn&rsquo;t go chaotic and make me sick. damn the sun!</li>
</ol>


<p>So yeah, in text that doesn&rsquo;t sound like much and I really should be able to get a short blurb out here and there. But I guess it&rsquo;s also that I really want to change this layout. Ughhh. I&rsquo;ll do that this weekend. Probably. Maybe. I dunno.</p>

<p>Also, the custom domain thing is killing me. It takes too long to load. Uber frustrating.</p>

<p>Until the next time I actually post. HUZZAH!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As of this current date and time, if you look to the right side column of this page, you&rsquo;ll see an embedded twitter widget. YES! I finally got around to putting that in there. I didn&rsquo;t have much on my twitter before, but I&rsquo;ve been tweeting a lot more about my learning process there, so why not?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve installed zsh in my command prompt and it wasn&rsquo;t working with my octopress blog so I had to switch back to bash. I&rsquo;ll have to configure that somehow. But yeah I learned how to switch between them.</p>

<p>Switch to bash:</p>

<pre><code>exec bash
</code></pre>

<p>Switch to zsh</p>

<pre><code>exec zsh
</code></pre>

<p>Yeah that&rsquo;s pretty straight forward.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m really enjoying this Code Fellows bootcamp. I&rsquo;ve learned so much in such a great environment. By that I mean, the actual physical building itself and the people that surround me, but also the programming environment. It&rsquo;s so cool.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m starting my Intro to HTML &amp; CSS course today. SUPER EXCITED!</p>

<p>We have to come prepared with materials for a mock website. It&rsquo;s just for funsies so I&rsquo;m going to create a website compiling all my cartoon drawings. I was thinking I&rsquo;d just include all of my artsy stuff, but nah. The simple cartoon idea will be enough for class and I&rsquo;ll just implement everything I learn into making this blog better. I&rsquo;d rather just have one site for now. You know, make one site look hella good.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still fumbling around with the code fellows HTML problem. UGH. I can&rsquo;t get the append function to work the way I want it to. Hopefully, I&rsquo;ll learn about it or can ask someone about it in the HTML class I take tonight.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the most recent cartoon I drew at work:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-g0nhTW2a7-I/Uc8f4uhZ5hI/AAAAAAAAC5U/zhrZveApsyw/s1600/IMG020.jpg" width="600"></p>

<p>I need to get a new phone. Apparently, I&rsquo;m not receiving incoming calls and my text messages aren&rsquo;t going out. Boo. Plus, the camera is getting iffy. BLAH. I&rsquo;ve gotta save up though.</p>

<p>OH! I totally had $5.30 surplus from my little budget experiment. Bwahaha! I&rsquo;m so good at budgeting. The last thing I bought in June was food for this week. Oh the things I can get with $5.30. That&rsquo;s like, a whole &lsquo;nother week of food almost! Cheap asian produce market ftw!</p>

<p>&mdash; update 6:57pm &mdash;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m at the class right now and I feel so&hellip;cool. Haha. :)</p>

<p>Like, there are all these women here with their laptops setup and ready to learn this techy stuff. YAY!</p>

<p>I feel like I&rsquo;m a part of something and it&rsquo;s nice. Huzzah!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Earlier this morning, I got an email from Code Fellows saying I&rsquo;m in the &ldquo;<em>final pool</em>&rdquo; of applications. They&rsquo;ll be deciding next week who gets in. Oh man, the past week has been so stressful with regards to Code Fellows. The past month if anything!</p>

<p>The challenge questions they sent were fairly simple in theory, as in I understood what they wanted, but in practice&hellip;AGHH!! I realized early on that I totally did not know enough to do any of the problems so I did what I do best which is to self teach. My eyes have been killing me the past week because of how much I&rsquo;ve been reading.</p>

<p>Between work, school and lack of technical skills, I asked for an extension on the time the problems were to be due and they said that was fine. Often times, I&rsquo;d feel bad that I was taking so long to get the stuff done, but man! I really don&rsquo;t know this stuff! I&rsquo;m trying really hard to get it all done though. I&rsquo;m almost there. The first question using Ruby is done. The HTML one is still troubling me.</p>

<p>Right after I got the email from Code Fellows this morning, I got an email from this women&rsquo;s tech meetup. The subject was &ldquo;Intro to HTML and CSS.&rdquo; I read the subject and was like, &ldquo;OMG THAT&rsquo;S EXACTLY WHAT I NEED RIGHT NOW!&rdquo; Unfortunately, I need it now instead of next week when the classes are offered, but I signed up anyway. It&rsquo;s a 4 class series. I think it&rsquo;ll be beneficial. The email said only 5 spots were left. When I finally got around to checking it out, there was only 1 spot left. I took it.</p>

<p>So yeah. I&rsquo;m gonna be doing that for the month of July on Tuesday nights. DB classes Monday and Wednesday nights. If I get into Code Fellows, it&rsquo;ll be M-F 9am-4pm. I think I read that some people stay after 4pm to work on stuff, but I really want to finish my DB classes. I really enjoy them.</p>

<p>Okay, back to learning more about HTML. At least enough to finish this problem!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Seriously, I feel like my brain is pushing against my skull. I&rsquo;m soaking in so much information right now. I told someone I&rsquo;m &ldquo;drying my eyes out&rdquo; trying to learn ruby and html.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I received a message about scholarships for Code Fellows if I got into the program. I sent answers to the scholarship questions then this morning I received another message about final application questions. More like, final application problems. I have to create some stuff and holy moly bologna! The things I have to make are a little beyond my scope, but I mean, that&rsquo;s kind of what&rsquo;s making this all so fun. I&rsquo;m learning all this crazy shizzniz.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been getting really frustrated trying to figure these things out, but I think ten hours later, I&rsquo;m really getting somewhere. There are three problems and I&rsquo;ve pretty much got all of them half done. I think that&rsquo;s a good start! Haha. In theory, I know what I need to do, it&rsquo;s just making it all be real that I&rsquo;m working on. If I could use MS Access or better yet, SQL Server, I could get all this done pretty quickly, but I&rsquo;ve gotta build it all from scratch so yeah. That&rsquo;s the point! To learn!</p>

<p>Something I&rsquo;ve learned about myself is that my frustration dances and my success dances are pretty much the same; the only differences are my facial expressions. I jump up and down, express obscenities, thrash my limbs around, it looks like I&rsquo;m squinting in both dances. In my frustrated dance, I glare at everything. In my success dance I&rsquo;m smiling. Haha. I think I can model that! But I&rsquo;ll do that a little later. I gotta finish these things.</p>

<p>Huzzahhh!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Currently, I have 50 bucks in my wallet. My goal for the rest of the month is not to spend any money at all (besides automatic payments for bills) and if I really have to, then that 50 bucks in my wallet will be my fund. I mean, I&rsquo;ll still have my debit and credit cards, but I really want to see if I can do this. I used to live off of so little and now that I&rsquo;m more financially secure, I&rsquo;ve been splurging on going out to eat with people.</p>

<p>Actually, yeah this monetary limitation will help with my diet because I&rsquo;ve been eating out way too much and getting hives. I&rsquo;ll have to dedicate a page to my histamine intolerance.</p>

<p>To do list for this blog:</p>

<pre><code>- landing page (index)
- change the font to the post titles
- add youtube plugin
- add disqus account
- page: singing videos
- page: art projects 
- page: histamine intolerance
- change domain
- twitter? (eh, I don't use it that much)
</code></pre>

<p>That&rsquo;s it so far.</p>

<p>Even though I didn&rsquo;t code this whole blog from scratch on my own (totally don&rsquo;t know enough to do that right now), I definitely do find joy and fulfillment in learning how to change the code as I please. Yay for technology!</p>

<p>But yeah, it&rsquo;d be so ballin&#8217; if I get into Code Fellows (I should hear back from them by the end of this week or early next week whether I get in or not). If I don&rsquo;t get in, then I&rsquo;m gonna really focus on learning more database and programming. Also, I&rsquo;m getting my diet straightened out so I need to really stick with that so I don&rsquo;t get sick so much. AND I renewed my membership for climbing so I gotta get my butt out to go exercise.</p>

<p>Ultimate frisbee this evening!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m gaining control of my life again. Thank gosh!</p>
